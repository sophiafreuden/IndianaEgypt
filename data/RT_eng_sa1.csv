"4 Jun, 2023",Dozens of peacekeepers killed by militants Ugandan president,"A Somali-based jihadist group has claimed responsibility for the attack At least 54 African Union (AU) peacekeepers died in a late May assault by al-Shabaab extremists on a base in Somalia housing Ugandan troops, Uganda's president said on Saturday. We discovered the lifeless bodies of 54 fallen soldiers, including a commander, Yoweri Museveni said in a statement posted to social media, referring to the May 26 dawn raid. He admitted last week that there had been Ugandan casualties in the attack, but had not specified the numbers. Al-Shabaab, a Somali-based Salafi-jihadist militant organization which has waged an insurgency for more than a decade against Somalia s western-backed government, has claimed responsibility for the assault. The group said it killed 137 soldiers in the attack, which involved a suicide-bombing. The AFP news agency reported, citing local residents and a Somali military commander, that the militants drove a car filled with explosives into a military facility in Bulo Marer, around 80 miles south-west of the capital, Mogadishu. A gunfight ensued, leading to one of the most significant death tolls in a string of violent incidents since pro-government forces supported by the AU, known as the African Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), began an offensive against al-Shabaab last August. The ATMIS force, whose members are estimated to number around 20,000, plays a more proactive role in Somali security operations than the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which it replaced. It is comprised of troops from Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, and has troops deployed in south and central Somalia. ATMIS plans to pass on its duties to Somalia s army and police forces by 2024. Museveni added in his statement that an initial panicked reaction to the attack contributed to the number of deaths in the AU ranks. The mistake was made by two commanders, Maj. Oluka and Maj. Obbo, who ordered the soldiers to retreat, he said, also stating that the pair had been apprehended and would face court martial charges. However, he added that our soldiers demonstrated remarkable resilience and reorganised themselves, resulting in the recapture of the base.

"4 Jun, 2023",Iran s trade with BRICS surging foreign minister,"Tehran is looking to join the bloc of five top emerging economies Trade between BRICS and Iran has been growing as Iran seeks to become a member of the alliance, according to the country s foreign minister. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was speaking at the Friends of BRICS session as part of the bloc s foreign ministers meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, on Friday. Our bilateral political and economic relations with the BRICS countries remain at a very good level while our trade value exceeds $30 billion, Amir-Abdollahian said, noting that the sides have important arrangements on multilateral cooperation. We will soon expand our relations with three BRICS countries; namely Russia, China, and India within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, he added. In June 2022, Iran applied to become a BRICS member, saying it would result in added value for both sides. Customs data shows that trade in goods other than crude oil between Iran and the bloc s members totaled nearly 48 million tons in the fiscal year 2022-2023, representing a 14% increase in terms of value. China remains Iran s main trade partner in the BRICS group, with trade up 37.41% during the period. India is second with trade up nearly 47%, and Russia is in third place (up 3.59%). Trade with Brazil has declined in both weight and value. South Africa is Iran s main trading partner on the African continent, with bilateral trade up by more than 23%. Russia and Iran have been strengthening ties in the face of Western economic sanctions. In 2022, the value of goods and services exchanged between the two countries reached $4.6 billion, according to official data. Moscow and Tehran have also reached an agreement to boost the use of their respective national currencies in settlements, as they push toward de-dollarization. BRICS, which currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is considering expanding its membership as a growing number of countries have expressed an interest in joining.

"4 Jun, 2023",Berlin issues demand to China,"Defense Minister Boris Pistorius wants Beijing to end its alleged policy of recruiting ex-Bundeswehr pilots German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said that he warned his Chinese counterpart, General Li Shangfu, against using former Bundeswehr pilots to train the Chinese military. I have made it clear that I expect this policy to be stopped immediately, Pistorius told reporters at the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore on Saturday, as quoted by Reuters. Berlin s defense chief claimed that Li did not deny the practice of hiring former German pilots, but downplayed its significance. According to Der Spiegel magazine, the meeting between Pistorius and Li, which was scheduled to last 30 minutes, went on for more than an hour. German media previously reported that former Bundeswehr service members have been finding jobs in China through companies in South Africa and New Zealand and were being paid large salaries to pass their knowledge to Chinese pilots. Der Spiegel described one such supposed case on Friday. According to the publication, a retired officer referred to as Alexander H., who used to train pilots to operate the Eurofighter Typhoon in Germany, was thought to have moved to China, where he allegedly trained pilots at an air base in Qiqihar. The fact that former Air Force officers are training fighter pilots in China is an outrage. We can t accept this, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the parliamentary defense committee, told Der Spiegel. Beijing has not commented on the matter. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin denied knowledge of such employment last year when responding to similar allegations made by the UK. In 2022, Britain s defense ministry said it would take measures against potential employment of former RAF service members in China. Australia said last year that it would investigate reports of its own retired Air Force pilots training Chinese military personnel. Relations between China and NATO have deteriorated significantly in recent years as both sides accuse each other of stoking tensions in the Taiwan Strait. The US-led alliance has described Beijing as a threat, while China accused the West of having a Cold War mentality. ",https://www.rt.com/news/577430-germany-china-pilot-training/
"3 Jun, 2023","Fyodor Lukyanov: Erdogan has won, what can the world, and Russia, expect from him now?","The veteran leader knows Moscow well, and the Kremlin understands his agenda. But how will it play out this time? ByFyodor Lukyanov,the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club. Recep Tayyip Erdogan s victory in the Turkish presidential election is supposed to mean there will be continuity in Ankara s foreign policy. However, in this case, it applies not so much to the content as to the approach that will be taken: most probably constant manoeuvring in search of opportunities. As a result, those preferences can change quite dramatically as circumstances transform, or when it becomes clear that they are not feasible. In the 20 years he has been in power, the Turkish president's goals have adjusted many times, sometimes quite diametrically, from Europeanization to Ottoman ideals, from promoting revolutions in the Middle East to actively rebuilding relations. Turkish colleagues tend to dislike arguments by foreigners about Ankara's neo-Ottomanism, calling them superficial and often far-fetched. This is probably true. However, it is an undeniable fact that the most important events for the entire region are taking place in the historical zone of Ottoman influence. And it is not possible to completely ignore centuries-old relationships. West Asia and North Africa now have a patchwork of distinct but interconnected problems. The conflicts in Libya and Yemen, now joined by Sudan, show little positive momentum. Israel is struggling to contain what it sees as threats to its security from all sides. Tensions around and within Iran are gradually rising. In addition to the nuclear program and the increasingly tangled relationship between Tehran and its neighbors in Azerbaijan, there has been new clash on the Iran-Afghanistan border. At the same time, revolutionary changes are taking place in the South Caucasus the long-running Karabakh conflict appears to be entering a new phase with a very different balance of power. Georgia s behavior is curious and rather unexpected. Syria is emerging from diplomatic isolation, but normalization with Turkiye, which occupies part of its territory, remains the main issue. Add to this the raging conflict in the Black Sea region, turmoil in the Balkans, the growing focus on Central Asia and unrest in Pakistan, and the mosaic is more than alarming. Fears abound, but is there anything to reassure us? There is something. As we have discussed before, this diverse and noisy part of the world is now forced more than ever to rely on itself, to find its own solutions to its problems. Outsiders are reducing both their activity and influence. Thefirstpoint is that there are so many concerns, globally, that even the strongest powers have to balance their capabilities and desires.The secondis the result of the activities of external powers in general, and especially in recent decades. Even if we assume that they have acted with the best of intentions (which in itself is not necessary, to put it mildly), the fruits are exceptionally inedible. It is clear that non-regional players will not be completely eliminated, but the balance of power is not shifting in their favor. Relations between the leading states and peoples of the region are now more important. That is why memories of the Ottoman period are in the air the roots go back to that time. Of course, it is not even pointless to draw parallels, it is simply harmful there is a danger of going completely off-topic. But the range of issues resonates, at least in part, with what has always been there. Trends in the Arab World, and in Arab relations with Iran, offer hope for normalization. The roles of Russia and China not leading, but supporting could be a catalyst for positive trends. The story of the South Caucasus is far from over and promises much human drama, but the deadlock it has been in for so long is a thing of the past. And so it follows that new opportunities are emerging. Turkiye is a key player in this whole puzzle, whether it wants to be or not. The only question is its capacity, and it s not entirely clear where the limits are here. The first and most important thing Erdogan will have to deal with is the economy. The rather bleak current situation did not prevent his re-election, but with nearly half the population eager for change, he cannot do anything else without economic growth. There is a complex interdependence between foreign policy ambitions and the ability to pay for them. But the resource base of a country like Turkiye transit-oriented and dependent on nature depends on its ability to pursue a complex and multidirectional assertive policy. Over the years, Erdogan has shown himself to be both an adventurous player and a prudent politician, capable of retreating when he realizes he has made a mistake. Judging by the election campaign, he has not lost these qualities. Russia is happy with this, although it should have no illusions about Ankara. Our interaction is not a cordial agreement, but an awareness that there is no escape from each other. However, this is a healthy awareness. And the manner of its implementation has already been worked out. ",https://www.rt.com/news/577417-russian-turkish-relations-erdogan/
"3 Jun, 2023",Saudi Arabia reveals trade volumes with BRICS nations,"The kingdom s foreign minister has called for further cooperation with the economic bloc The total value of bilateral trade between Saudi Arabia and BRICS member states topped $160 billion in 2022, making the kingdom the largest Middle Eastern trade partner of the bloc, Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah said on Friday. Speaking at a ministerial meeting of Friends of BRICS in the South African city of Cape Town, Prince Faisal also said the kingdom was planning to develop further cooperation with the BRICS group to achieve collective prosperity. The kingdom remains the BRICS group s largest commercial partner in the Middle East, he said. The total value of bilateral trade with the countries of the BRICS group increased from $81 billion in 2017 and 128 billion in 2021 and exceeded $160 billion in 2022. According to the minister, Saudi Arabia shares basic values with the BRICS countries, believing that relations between countries should be based on the principles of respect for sovereignty, non-interference, and adherence to international law. The BRICS group, which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, makes up 40% of the world s population and almost a third of the global economy. The bloc s latest meeting was attended by foreign ministers from the BRICS countries and 12 countries of the Global South that expressed a desire to join the bloc.

"2 Jun, 2023",India calls for UN Security Council reform,"The body is becoming archaic and is no longer fit for purpose, India s envoy says The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) needs urgent reform to increase representation for emerging economies and regions with growing political influence, India s permanent representative to the UN argued on Thursday. The current composition of the Security Council no longer aligns with the realities of our interconnected and multipolar world, Ruchira Kamboj said during a roundtable discussion on Security Council reform at the UN headquarters in New York, hosted by the permanent missions of Brazil, India, South Africa and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. She added that the council s structure was designed in a different era, and fails to give sufficient voice to the rise of new powers, the shifting geopolitical landscape and the aspirations of nations striving for a fairer and more equitable global order. It is a pragmatic necessity, the Indian diplomat argued, to expand the Security Council's membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories to countries which have demonstrated on the global stage a desire to promote peace, aid economic development, and address other global challenges. The United Nations Security Council was formed following World War II as a means for countries to collaborate on global security challenges. Its five permanent members the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom each have veto power on matters relating to sanctions, international negotiations, the deployment of peacekeeping missions, and the authorization of the use of force to address conflicts. The UNSC also has a range of non-permanent members, admitted on a rotational basis depending on their geographic regions. Among the ten current non-permanent members are Japan, Brazil, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. The topic of UNSC reform is regularly raised. Everyone agrees that the present structure [of the UNSC] is flawed, British international relations expert Paul Kennedy wrote in his 2006 book The Parliament of Man . But consensus on how to fix it remains out of reach. India, along with Brazil, Japan and Germany, has on several occasions lobbied to be included in an expanded list of permanent members. However, nations including Italy, Canada, Spain and South Korea are among a group called United for Consensus which has, since the 1990s, formally opposed any proposals to expand the UNSC permanent member base. Kamboj argued that modern challenges require modern solutions, and that UNSC reform is made more urgent by unprecedented global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and pandemics, which require collective efforts and shared responsibilities.

"2 Jun, 2023","The Black Sea grain deal has worked in the interests of the rich, not the poor would Russia be within its rights to withdraw?","Data shows that most of the produce exported by Ukraine goes to Western Europe, with only a very small amount reaching sub-Saharan Africa In mid-May, the UN Black Sea Initiative, widely known simply as ""the grain deal,"" was extended for another two months, until July 17. However, experts doubt whether this pact, designed to provide the poorest countries with food, will be prolonged any further. In the final days of May, a scandal broke out around several cargo ships that were blocked in the Black Sea. Six Turkish bulk carriers wereunableto leave Ukraine, and even more ships were halted at the entrance to the Bosphorus Strait. Meanwhile, Russiathreatenedto terminate the agreement. So what is really going on? The conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated just how fragile globalization can be. As a result of a conflict in Eastern Europe, many external economies have slid intorecession, politicians haveallocatedhuge funds from national budgets for aid, global trade has beenundermined, and billions of people have been put at risk of having their normal lives disrupted. The world has so far avoided a major energy shortage. The looming food crisis, however, has become a leading source of concern in the global media.According tothe UN, for the first time in decades, developed countries mayseea shortage of basic products while the world s poorer regions may face real famine. For this reason, a lot of attention is now directed at the deal, which allows grain and fertilizers to be exported from Ukraine via a safe corridor. This is also the reason why so many people became nervous when cargo ships wereblockedand stopped sailing. Mainstreammediaoutlets claim that while Russia selfishly delays the ships and halts navigation at sea, the Ukrainian authorities and the UN are doing all they can to free the Black Sea road of life and save the world from famine. Their version, however, is full of inconsistencies. If the cargo from Ukraine is so vital, then why do expertsbelievethat the Black Sea Initiative cannot solve the global food crisis? And why did EU members Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania placerestrictionson the import of Ukrainian grain? The role assigned to Russia is even more strange. Why would Moscow sabotage a deal that can save one of its key industries? What would it gain from violating agreements with an important partner, Turkiye? And finally, why would it risk new sanctions and make the path to peace even more thorny? The Black Sea Initiative came into effect on July 22, 2022. The agreement was signed by representatives of Russia, Ukraine, Turkiye, and the UN. The partiespledgedto organize and maintain a safe corridor for the export of grain and fertilizers from Ukraine s Port Yuzhny and via the Bosphorus Strait in order to prevent a global food shortage. For its part, Russia has promised not to interfere with the loading and unloading of cargo in the Black Sea, where fighting continues, and not to destroy infrastructure that is critically important for the grain deal. As for Ukraine, the terms of the agreement required it to coordinate shipments with inspectors and not to use the safe corridor for weapons and munitions supplies. Turkiye acted as a mediator and provided most of the cargo ships. The UN also promised to ease economic sanctions imposed on Russia. A Joint Coordination Center (JCC) with representatives from Russia, Ukraine, Turkiye, and the UN was established in Istanbul in order to monitor cargo shipment and sea traffic. The JCC had to ensure compliance with the agreement and inspect cargo ships as they entered and left the ports. Yuzhny (literally ""south) is the biggest deepwater port in Ukraine, and has all the necessary infrastructure for large ships. Coupled with its proximity to the battlefield, this makes the facility, near Odessa, strategically important. However, for the sake of the pact, Russiaagreedto lift a maritime blockade and limit the actions of its Armed Forces so they wouldn t interfere with the transit of ships. The grain deal ensures not only the export of grain from Ukraine, but also fertilizers and the resources necessary to produce them. This includes ammonia, used for producing nitrogen fertilizers. For most types of grain, these are a lot more important than phosphorus and potash. Without ammonia, the world's food production would beendangered. For Russia, it was particularly important to resume the operation of the Togliatti-Odessa ammonia pipeline, which wasresponsiblefor half of Russia s ammonia exports. The volumes were huge and met the needs of Estonia, Bulgaria, Finland, Belgium, Lithuania, Spain, Sweden, and other countries. Due to sanctions, Russia s huge ammonia production industry the second largest in the world after China suddenly lost most of its buyers. With the signing of the grain deal in July of last year, this situation was supposed to be resolved. The grain deal was valid until October 2022. Then came the attacks on the Crimean Bridge and Russian Navy infrastructure in Sevastopol. The Russian Defense Ministrysaidthe ships used for the second attack were stationed in the safe corridor. On the same day, the Black Sea Initiative was halted. On November 2, the Russian Ministry of Defensereceivedwritten guarantees from Ukraine that the Black Sea corridor would not be used for military purposes. The pact was resumed and later extended several times. However, the many problems concerning the agreement itself were never resolved. Themainstream narrativeassures us that the grain deal was concluded to avoid the disruption of important supply chains from Ukraine. The armed conflict disrupted the export of grain, and even its storage became difficult and dangerous. Since the whole world could face a food crisis as a result of these actions, all parties agreed on a compromise. But now, Russia is sabotaging the agreement and threatening to disrupt supplies in order to achieve its goals. In reality, things are a lot more complicated. Ukrainian agricultural exports are definitely important for the global economy. Before the start of the conflict, Ukrainewasthe world s third largest supplier of maize one of the most important cereal grains. Its production rate was exceeded only by the United States and Argentina. Ukrainian agriculture was quite successful in other aspects as well. Russia s agriculture industry, however, easily surpasses it. Russia is one of the global guarantors of food security and the largest supplier of wheat and ammonia providing 17% and 20% of the world s total market supply, respectively, before February of last year. Since then, however, the Russian agricultural industry has been hit by sanctions. The Russian Agricultural Bank the main payment operator in the agricultural industry was disconnected from SWIFT, the Western assets of agriculture producers and exporters have been frozen, the supply of agricultural equipment, spare parts, and service to Russia has been halted, and exports have been hit. A bunch of hastysanctionsturned out to be more catastrophic for the world's food supplies than missiles and bullets. The problems caused by an interruption in Ukrainian grain supplies do not even come close to those caused by the boycott of Russian agricultural products. Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushevbelievesthat, given the opportunity, Russian exports could fully replace and exceed those of Ukraine. The UN quickly assumed the role of defender of the weak and hungry andsaidthat its mission in the initiative was to stabilize food prices and prevent hunger that will impact millions. Unfortunately, the noble plan turned out to be questionable in practice. The UN s ownstatisticsshow that 50% of all cargo exported under the grain deal is sent to other parts of Europe. Another 26% goes to East Asia, 15% is sent to the Middle East and North Africa, and 5% goes to South Asia. Only 2.5% of the grain and fertilizers concerned are dispatched to Sub-Saharan Africa, where about 240 million people lack adequate nutrition. Instead of aiding a region that already suffers from a severe food crisis recently exacerbated by severe droughts where, according to somesources, one person dies of hunger every 48 seconds the UN helps Europeans save money on food, which ensures that politicians don t lose the support of voters. The UN appears to be in no hurry to fulfill its obligations to Russia, established in the Memorandum of Understanding, either. Over the past 10 months, Russian producers of agricultural products and fertilizers have not received the promised access to global markets. Apparently, to save the world from hunger, only grain and fertilizers of Ukrainian origin would do. The Togliatti-Odessa ammonia pipeline stands idle as Kiev continues setting newconditionsand demands new ports to be included in the pact in order to make control over the shipped goods even more difficult. As a result of this deal, Russia faces only restrictions, Turkiye can t do anything with the ships stuck in the ports, the UN has to maneuver between incompatible interests, and the world s poor struggle to survive. The only beneficiary of the Black Sea Initiative is Kiev. With the help of the UN, for Ukrainian officials the deal turned into a way to make easy money. Seeing that anti-Russian sanctions caused a large niche to open up in the market, Ukraine decided to take advantage of it. While reducing its cheaper exports of maize a popular staple in poor countries it increased exports of wheat, sought-after in richer state. The imbalance has become so striking that Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romaniaset restrictionson the import of Ukrainian grain. These countries announced a sudden thousandfold increase in grain supplies from Ukraine, and as a result, local farmers could not sell their crops. Instead of providing vital food supplies that can save lives, Ukrainian officials are busy making money from the crisis. Dubious Ukrainian tactics don t stop there, however. A source close to the JCC who wished to remain anonymous, spoke about the pressure exerted on Russian inspectors. When we refuse to approve the departure of unprepared or non-compliant ships, we are simply held onboard until we give forced consent. Our complaints are ignored, and no one pays attention to our opinion. Thus, Russian inspectors are no longer able to check the type and volume of goods being loaded onto the ships in Ukrainian ports. Ukraine also refused to seek a compromise during the suspension of the deal. The Russian Navy tried toease the situation and offered to lead the Turkish ships stuck in Yuzhny along another route that is not included in the Black Sea Initiative. The Russian Navy was also ready to clear the sea route of mines and escort the ships. On May 24, three days before the planned departure, drones attacked the Russian intelligence ship Ivan Khurs, responsible for the security of the TurkStream and Blue Stream gas pipelines. The attack was successfullyrepelled,the ship safely returned to the naval base in Sevastopol, and the crew received awards. But the command could not risk either their ships or the lives of the crew of a neutral state. As a result, the departure of Turkish bulk carriers was further postponed. Coincidentally, Ivan Khurs wasattackedby British-made drones, operated from Ochakov: a naval center opened and equipped with the help of the United States. Despite various provocations and dishonesty in fulfilling the obligations of the agreement, the grain deal was extended for another 60 days. For its part, Russia is ready to stick to its obligations. Of course, Moscow is acting in its own interests the Togliatti-Odessa pipeline will allow it to return to an important ammonia market, and the restoration of normal trade will help Russian agriculture. Perhaps this can even help balance the currently unstable food market. However, there s more to the matter than that. Moscow is not interested in destabilizing the entire world. Famine in Africa can lead not only to mass deaths, but also to a new wave of migration to more developed countries that don t have food shortages. Given that Europe, of which Russia is the biggest part, barely managed the crisis presented by Syrian migrants, the influx of another possibly even larger wave of refugees will lead to unimaginable consequences. However, the longer the deal remains one-sided and the regulators are biased, the less chance Moscow has of fulfilling its side of the agreement. After all, for Russia, the deal restricts both the army and the economy without any benefits in return. The words of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov best reflect Russia s position. If everything remains as it is, and, apparently, it will, then we will have to proceed from the fact that it (the grain deal) is no longer functioning, hesaidat a recent press conference. The importers may come up with alternative solutions and try to partially replace Ukrainian supplies. However, to do this quickly and without the help of Russia as one of the main producers of grain and fertilizers in the world will be difficult, to say the least. A mistake like that is bound to come at a high price not just raising price tags in supermarkets, but spurring a real global crisis.

For Argentina, membership of the bank offers the prospect of accessing financial assistance, the news outlet noted. To meet entry requirements, Argentina will have to make a contribution worth $250 million in sovereign bonds to the BRICS bank from its treasury. The talks come at a time when the NDB is negotiating with Saudi Arabia on admitting the kingdom as the tenth member of the BRICS bank. The NDB was launched with the purpose of financing infrastructure and sustainable development in member states and other emerging economies.

The court accused them of the forcible transfer of population, referring to Moscow s efforts to evacuate children from combat zones amid the hostilities with Ukraine. Russia responded by saying the ICC has no authority or legitimacy, as Moscow never ratified the 1998 Rome Statute that established the court. Under its current laws, South Africa is obliged to arrest the Russian president if he enters the country, as it is a member of the ICC. In August, Johannesburg is scheduled to host the summit of BRICS a group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Meanwhile, youth activist and Pan-Africanism scholar, Mcebo Freedom Dlamini, claimed that the ICC is biased [and] has allowed itself to be used in a political ballgame. Russia has been our friend when it was not fashionable, when no European country wanted to associate with us, he added. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/577258-icc-africa-law-putin-warrant/
"1 Jun, 2023",South Africa marks anniversary of end of Boer War (VIDEO),"A former minister told RT that the imperialist powers involved in the conflict had no right to wage war on her nation s territory The 121st anniversary of the end of the Second Boer War in South Africa was marked on Wednesday. The 3-year conflict lasted from 1899 to 1902 and was marked by the early use of concentration camps by the British imperial forces. It is estimated that over 26,000 Boer women and children died in the camps. The war resulted in the establishment of British rule over most of what is now South Africa. Lindiwe Sisulu, a former tourism minister, described the colonial era as one of the most shameful pages of history. The Africans were just standing by with nobody to protect them... Something like 100,000 black people died for no reason in a war that had nothing to do with them, Sisulu told RT. [The British] had superior arms. They overcame us, she added. She emphasized that colonialists did not apologize for their despicable act, but instead devised new strategies, in the form of trade relations, to maintain their dominance, after it became clear that they had no place on the African continent.

"1 Jun, 2023",Moscow dismisses reports of BRICS summit venue change,"Suggestions that the event could be moved due to Vladimir Putin s ICC warrant are a hoax, says Russian Deputy FM Sergey Ryabkov Russia has quashed reports suggesting that this summer s BRICS summit could be moved from South Africa to China due to the International Criminal Court s (ICC) arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Responding to the reports, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov described the suggestions as a hoax. I think that this is from the category of information stuffing. From my contacts with colleagues from South Africa and from China, there is no basis to somehow operationalize this matter. This is not the plot that we are discussing here, he told journalists in Cape Town on Thursday. He stated that the summit, which will include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, will be held as agreed in Johannesburg at the end of August. There is no other date today, and I don t think that this topic needs to be spun any further, Ryabkov said. The diplomat suggested that the false reports were an attempt to complicate regular work in the BRICS format, and an attempt to impose some kind of false agenda. We work calmly, under the plan that is well known: that the summit will be held in Johannesburg this year, and in Kazan (Russia) next year, Ryabkov said. The deputy foreign minister s comments come after Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous official, that South Africa may ask China to host the upcoming BRICS summit to avoid having to deal with the ICC s arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. The ICC issued the warrant in March, accusing the Russian president of war crimes based on Ukraine s claims that children had been forcibly relocated during the ongoing military conflict between the two countries. Moscow has insisted that civilians were not forcibly removed but evacuated from an area under Ukrainian artillery fire. Russia has also said it does not recognize the ICC s jurisdiction, making the warrant null and void. South Africa, on the other hand, as a signatory of the Rome Statute, is legally obligated to execute ICC arrest warrants, even if they pertain to world leaders such as Vladimir Putin. Pretoria has been considering passing a law that would grant it discretion in enforcing such warrants. ",https://www.rt.com/russia/577286-brics-summit-change-hoax/

"31 May, 2023",South Africa considering change of BRICS summit venue Reuters,"Officials are reportedly discussing the idea of moving the upcoming meeting to China due to ICC charges against Vladimir Putin South Africa may ask China to host the upcoming BRICS summit in August, so it would not have to deal with the International Criminal Court s arrest warrant for the Russian president, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous government official. The meeting, involving Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, is scheduled to begin on August 22. Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to attend back in January however in March the ICC charged him with war crimes, based on Ukraine s claims that children were forcibly removed during the armed conflict between the two neighbors. Moscow replied that the civilians were evacuated from Ukrainian artillery fire and that, because Russia does not recognize the ICC s jurisdiction, the warrant was null and void. South Africa, however, is a signatory party to the Rome Statute that chartered the ICC, and would be legally obligated to arrest Putin should he come to visit. One of the options gaining traction in Pretoria is to ask China to host the BRICS event, according to a senior government official who spoke with the agency on condition of anonymity. Like Moscow, Beijing is not a party to the Rome Statute. Because of our legal obligations, we have to arrest President Putin, but we can t do that, former South African President Thabo Mbeki said in a radio interview last week, explaining that the BRICS summit is unlikely to take place in South Africa for that reason. South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandorsaid on Tuesdaythat the diplomatic immunity extended to all summit attendees does not override any warrant that may have been issued by any international tribunal. Pretoria was considering passing a law that would give it some discretion in enforcing the ICC arrest warrants, Deputy Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Obed Bapela told the BBC on Tuesday. However, a justice department official who spoke with Reuters anonymously said there was not enough time to get such a law through parliament before the summit. There has been no firm decision, Zane Dangor, director-general of the department of international relations, told Reuters. He said the ministers assigned to the matter will meet soon to consider a report setting out all the options. Kremlin spokesman DmitryPeskov said on Tuesdaythat Russia will take part in the BRICS summit at the proper level, and added that Moscow expected partner countries such as South Africa not to be guided by illegal decisions such as the ICC warrant.

"31 May, 2023",Time to ditch the dollar Cuban president,"With US dominance broken, the BRICS nations can build a fairer world, Miguel Diaz-Canel told RT Giving up the US dollar will free developing countries from Washington s sanctions, blackmail, aggression, and slander, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel told RT in an exclusive interview due to air on Thursday. The dollar s status as the world s reserve currency enables the US to pursue an aggressive hegemonistic policy of building walls, imposing punitive sanctions, blackmail, aggression and slander, Diaz-Canel said. Against this policy which has seen Cuba embargoed for six decades by the US Diaz-Canel added that BRICS provides a brilliant alternative for economic integration, especially for developing economies. Since it was first coined in 2001, BRICS has grown from an acronym for five emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa into an informal alliance that hasovertakenthe US-led G7 bloc in its share of global GDP, has its own development bank, and counts Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Argentina among 19 prospective members. Amid calls for a common BRICS currency to settle trade bills, members of the group have begun to conduct more bilateral trade in theirown currencies, eschewing the US dollar. I believe that we need to recognize the leading role of Russia in shaping this multipolar world, Diaz-Canel said, stating that continued de-dollarization will lead to more inclusive and more mutually beneficial trade for those who reject the US lies and empty promises. Although Cuba is not a member of the BRICS group, the island nation has been a close partner of Russia since the days of the Soviet Union, and trade between Moscow and Havana tripled last year to $452 million. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko visited Cuba last week, where he announced that Russian firms were planning more investment in the country s tourism sector. It is at times like this that we get friends from other countries supporting us with real actions and under conditions that are not harmful to our independence, Diaz-Canel told RT.

"31 May, 2023",India scraps in-person SCO summit,"With a little more than a month to go, New Delhi has decided without explanation to hold the head-of-state level meeting virtually ByJoydeep Sen Gupta, Asia Editor India s Ministry of External Affairs has announced that the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) slated for July 4 will now be held virtually rather than in person. India holds the rotating presidency for the annual summit. The SCO s other member states are China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Iran, Belarus, and Mongolia have been invited as observers for the elite regional event, which holds significance for Eurasia and beyond. As per SCO tradition, Turkmenistan has also been invited as the guest of the chair. The heads of six international and regional organizations such as the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building measures in Asia (CICA), were also expected to attend, India s Ministry of External Affairs said a in press statement. It was not immediately clear what prompted India to drop its plan to host the SCO summit in New Delhi on July 4. The country hosted an in-person meeting of the SCO foreign ministers in Goa on May 4-5, and there was no indication at that time that a plan for a virtual meeting of the heads of state was in the works. Though virtual summits became common due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the practice has largely been done away with for diplomatic events since last year. Besides, India, unlike South Africa, which is slated to host the upcoming BRICS summit, is not a signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued a warrant for the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to sources at the Ministry of External Affairs, India had initially wanted to hold the SCO summit on June 25, but the date was later revised to the first week of July. The original summit date was sceduled to dovetail with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi s visit to the US, which is planned for June 22, as Washington bids to deepen ties with the world s largest democracy and wean New Delhi away from Moscow s embrace. The virtual nature of the SCO summit will also deprive Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi of an opportunity to visit India, despite Iran being tipped to become a full member of the SCO. Though the announcement that the summit will be held virtually was made on Tuesday evening, the decision was reportedly taken a few weeks ago when all preparations to host the high-profile event were put on hold. The SCO foreign ministers meeting in Goa was overshadowed by a verbal joust between archrivals India and Pakistan. India s career diplomat-turned-foreign minister, Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, hit out at his Pakistani counterpart, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, calling him a spokesperson of the terror industry. Bhutto Zardari was the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India since Hina Rabbani Khar in 2011. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would have attended the July summit, despite the growing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, even though there was no possibility of any bilateral talks on the sidelines of the event. All eyes are now on the G20 summit to be held in New Delhi on September 9-10 where Putin and China s Xi Jinping, along with Biden, have been invited, as well as the other heads of state of the group. Last year s SCO summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan made headlines after Modi told Putin that this is not an era of war . New Delhi has been citing the prime minister s viral remark to deflect criticisms by the Western powers that it is soft on Moscow s military operation in Ukraine, which entered its second year on February 24.

Speaking at a press conference in Mozambique, Lavrov was asked to comment on claims made by the US ambassador to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, who alleged earlier this month that Pretoria had sent arms and ammunition to Moscow. If an American or any other overseas ambassador starts seeing things, generally [he] must know his place and mind his own business, Lavrov said. He added that Russia never violates international norms regarding arms shipments, which he claimed could not be said about the West. Instead, Western nations have declared neutrality over events in Ukraine while pumping this country with enormous amounts of modern long-range weaponry, Lavrov stated. Some of the arms supplied to Ukraine are even unsafe for those who use them, including anti-tank shells containing depleted uranium provided by the UK, Lavrov added. Perhaps, US envoys should take care of their own image in the eyes of foreign public, the Russian foreign minister said. US envoy Brigety claimed earlier in May that a weapons cargo had been loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship, Lady R, which docked at South Africa s main naval base near Cape Town last December. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described the allegations as unfounded but announced an investigation into the matter. The South African Foreign Ministry later claimed that Brigety had admitted that he crossed the line with his remarks. South Africa has enjoyed close ties with Russia since the days of the Soviet Union. It has refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow amid the Ukraine conflict, and has repeatedly called for peace negotiations. Earlier this month, Ramaphosa reiterated his nation s neutrality, explaining that South Africa does not want to be drawn into a contest between global powers.

Dr. Tumi BB Senokoane, a professor at the University of South Africa, told RT that forming one currency for all of Africa is not an impossible task. The idea behind the de-dollarization of the currency... stems from the background that Africa wants to rely [on its] own currency in purchasing, exchanging of goods and also in creating reserves for Africa as a continent.

"31 May, 2023",Unfreedom: Fifty Years Later,"In the 1970s, the Soviets made it impossible to access the foreign press. Now the US-led bloc is doing the same with Russian media. ByYakov Rabkin, a professor emeritus of history at the Université de Montréal, author and public intellectual Nearly fifty years ago I emigrated from the Soviet Union. My only reason for leaving all that was known to me was a deep longing for freedom of expression. I resented restrictions on foreign publications and deplored the practice of jamming foreign radio stations like the BCC World Service or Radio Canada International. It was as if the media were just obediently regurgitating the party line, with no room for real discussion or debate. Sure, the authorities weren t as oppressive as they were during Stalin s reign, but a lingering fear remained. It cast a shadow over political discussions, confining them to a small circle of trusted friends. Expressing our true thoughts and opinions felt like walking a tightrope. I left behind my native city of Leningrad (now Saint-Petersburg), my friends, my brother, the tombs of my parents and grandparents. It was risky to apply for emigration since one would almost always lose employment and find oneself socially ostracized while remaining uncertain if Soviet authorities would grant the exit visa. I was lucky. Within a few months, in May 1973 I was stripped of Soviet citizenship and allowed to purchase a one-way ticket to Vienna. My dream of freedom was fulfilled. The first thing I bought in Vienna was a copy of The International Herald Tribune. In November 1973 I joined the University of Montreal, my professional home ever since. Beyond teaching and research, I eagerly followed political debates about the Vietnam War, the CIA-organized overthrow of the Allende government in Chile, the fallout from the October War in Israel. Debates raged about the U.S. overtures to China, and, of course, about the relations with my former country. Some praised the Brezhnev-Nixon détente, others worried about its pitfalls. What impressed me most was the variety of opinions that found their way into newspaper pages and TV screens. Op-ed articles and letters to the editor offered a broad gamut of views, some of them not only criticizing policies but offering viable alternatives. Soon I began to voice my opinion, first in letters to the editor, later in op-ed articles. It was inebriating to assume my civic and intellectual responsibility partaking in free political debate. Today, this freedom is being eroded with respect to several foreign policy issues. One is Israel. Journalists and politicians think twice before criticizing it. They fear to be accused of antisemitism. In the early 1970s, Abba Eban, the eloquent South Africa-born Israeli foreign minister, developed a strategy to stifle criticism of his country by accusing critics of antisemitism. This strategy has since triumphed: today, qualifying Israel s treatment of the Palestinians as apartheid, or even peaceful boycott of Israeli products in the supermarket, are officially banned as antisemitic in many Western countries. This makes Israel exceptional and shields it from rational debate. Another even more important issue that has disappeared from rational public debate is Western policy towards Russia. This issue is more important not only because Russia is bigger, but because it involves a potential nuclear annihilation of life on Earth. Well before February 2022, most NATO countries (as well as Ukraine before them) curtailed access to Russian media, something that never happened in the West during the Cold War. Just as Soviet authorities justified jamming of Western radio broadcasts as a measure against imperialist subversion , a panoply of NATO and national agencies now protect citizens in Europe and North America from Russian disinformation . Prominent Western scholars such as Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University and John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago have been marginalized and disappeared from mainstream media. Their questioning of Western policies towards Russia is dismissed as Kremlin s talking points . The war in Ukraine has morphed into a moral issue. Questioning the West s position on the Russia-Ukraine war is simply out of the question. Moreover, the few attempts to examine Western policies in Eastern Europe come against insurmountable obstacles. For example, when the association Montréal pour la paix (Montreal for Peace) attempted to organize a debate involving well-known experts on international relations and Canada s foreign policy, it promised to present facts that you have never read or heard from our media and the offices of Justin Trudeau and Mélanie Joly (Canada s prime minister and minister of Global Affairs, respectively). The institution that initially agreed to rent its space succumbed to pressure from, as it put it, Ukrainian neighbours , and cancelled the rental. Another one accepted to rent its space but promptly reneged lest it offend its regular clients . Faced with these setbacks the event had to be moved to a nearby park. There were three speakers, a few dozen middle-aged, mostly grey-haired people who came to listen to them and about the same number of young vigorous protesters brandishing Ukrainian flags and anti-Russia posters. They tried to drown out the speakers in noise and loud songs. Police was brought in to separate the two groups and prevent violence. But there transpired something peculiar in the behaviour of the demonstrators. When one of the speakers, Yves Engler, an author known for his incisive books on Canadian foreign policy, said that Ukrainians have the right to resist Russian troops, the rowdy protesters started chanting Shame of you! The entire event took place in French, but it became clear that most of the demonstrators did not know any French. The object of their anger could therefore not be the content of what was being said. They were protesting the very freedom to discuss the war in Ukraine. This was just one instance of how suppression of debate on Russia and Ukraine spans the whole gamut of venues from grassroots events to university campuses to the media. Freedom of debate is not only a democratic right. It is also a vital mechanism for formulating and evaluating political alternatives. When a conflict is transformed into an epic struggle between Good and Evil, self-righteousness undermines the potential for diplomacy under the guise of moral rectitude. The late Chief Rabbi of Britain Jonathan Sachs astutely observed that righteousness and self-righteousness are mutually exclusive . Indeed, this ostensibly moral suppression of debate increases the chances of a nuclear war and its corollary, which U.S. strategists aptly defined in 1962 as MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction. The current climate of unfreedom not only undermines our core values. It poses an existential threat for humankind.

The current aim of the NDB is to expand links and infrastructure across the bloc and boost the quality of life in member states, the Russian minister stated. The task of the BRICS is to unite, not to divide. Therefore, when the BRICS countries decided to create the NDB, we pursued one simple goal: to create a financial institution for developing countries, so that we all have an additional tool to support our joint development agenda, Siluanov said. According to Siluanov, the bank should focus on areas such as facilitating the transfer of technology and promoting innovation, as well as solving food and energy security problems, developing sustainable infrastructure, and creating development potential. It is important that the NDB remains open to admitting new members and cooperating with all international organizations, Siluanov stressed. The Shanghai-based NDB was established in 2014 by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and formally opened for business a year later. It was later joined by Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Uruguay. Saudi Arabia is also in talks to become a member, the Financial Times reported last week.

O Neill coined the term BRIC later expanded to include South Africa and at the time predicted that the four emerging countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) were on their way to reshaping the world economy. The idea that the dollar will remain king forever, I think, is probably unlikely, the economist said in an interview with TV show Going Underground. This is not the first time that people have talked about the end of the dollar, it happens every other year if not with the same intensity he said, adding that the US currency would probably at some point lose its position. I do think if China and India could ever strongly agree on things as the two biggest countries in the emerging world then that would probably hasten the end of the dollar s dominance, he stated. According to the economist, the shape of the world economy has shifted since the advent of the BRICS concept. In purchasing power parity terms, the BRICS share of global GDP is now greater than that of the G7 in dollar terms, O Neill pointed out. According to him, a growing number of countries are considering joining BRICS, but the group of five should determine what new members can actually bring to the table. In that case it is possible to seriously think that the BRICS countries could be at the basis of some new kind of not only currency but some kind of competitor to the US financial system, O Neill explained, adding that in order for the dollar to end, there has to be some alternative. Turning to Russia and Western sanctions, the economist said Moscow was doing better than those who imposed the sanctions believed, and that that was essentially due to its strong links with the BRICS member states. However, it is not entirely clear whether Russia would continue to be able to cope with the persistence of sanctions, because the scale of restrictions is getting tougher, he warned.

"30 May, 2023",South Africa clarifies diplomatic immunity stance amid Putin visit hopes,"The country is due to host BRICS gatherings later this year South Africa will grant diplomatic immunity to foreign dignitaries attending upcoming BRICS meetings, although this will not override warrants issued by international courts, the Foreign Ministry has said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to attend the summit of BRICS leaders in August, but is the subject of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC). In a statement on Monday, South Africa s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor, said immunities and privileges[will]be accorded to the participants of the BRICS Ministerial Meeting and the BRICS Summit, which are scheduled to take place in Cape Town in June and in Johannesburg in August respectively. However, the Foreign Ministry clarified on its Facebook page on Tuesday that granting diplomatic immunity to visiting foreign dignitaries is standard procedure, and does not apply to any specific individual. [The procedures] are meant to protect the conference and its attendees from the jurisdiction of the host country for the duration of the conference, the statement explained. It added that these immunities do not override any warrant that may have been issued by any international tribunal against any attendee of the conference. In mid-March, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the presidential commissioner for children s rights. The court accused them of the forcible transfer of population, referring to Moscow s efforts to evacuate children from combat zones amid the hostilities with Ukraine. Russia responded by noting it does not recognize the authority or legitimacy of the ICC, as Moscow did not ratify the 1998 Rome Statute that established the court. Russian authorities have also initiated criminal proceedings against the ICC s head prosecutor and the three judges involved in issuing the warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova. South Africa is an ICC participant, and the country s leadership has issued mixed messages regarding any potential steps, should Putin attend the BRICS summit in person. In an interview with the BBC last week, the secretary-general of South Africa s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, Fikile Mbalula, said that if it were according to the ANC, we would want President Putin to be here, even tomorrow, to come to our country. At the same time, Mbalula acknowledged that we re constrained by the ICC in terms of doing that. Last month, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pledged to leave the ICC altogether, only for his office to backtrack one day later, saying that the leader had made the remarks erroneously.

According to him, those behind the move are trying to maintain trading and commerce privilege. In March, the International Criminal Court called for the arrest of Putin and Russian children s rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of the forcible transfer of population, referring to Moscow s efforts to evacuate children from the combat zone. Moscow responded bysayingthe ICC has no authority or legitimacy, as Russia never ratified the 1998 Rome Statute that established the court.

The ICC move cast a shadow over the upcoming BRICS summit, which is scheduled for August and will be hosted by South Africa. The country s officials have produced mixed signals on the prospect of enforcing the warrant. The decolonization of South Africa has led to the perpetuation of economic dependency, while as much as 70% of the economy of the country is dominated by British and American and other European capital, said Thomashausen, who spoke to RT as the continent marked Africa Day.

The move is expected to cement ties between the Shanghai-based lender, established by BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) back in 2014, with the world s second biggest producer of oil. In the Middle East, we attach great importance to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and are currently engaged in a qualified dialogue with them, the NDB said in a statement seen by FT. Launched with the purpose of financing infrastructure and sustainable development in member states and other emerging economies, the NDB has expanded its membership to include Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Egypt. It has lent $33 billion to more than 96 projects in the five founding member nations. The multinational financial institution is preparing to embark on a formal evaluation of its funding options, which were shaken after Russia was hit by several waves of Western sanctions over its military operation in Ukraine. The BRICS bank is scheduled to hold its annual meeting from May 30-31. For Riyadh, membership in the bank offers the prospect of strengthening bonds with the BRICS member states. The five economies account for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP. The talks also come at a time when Saudi Arabia and China are increasing co-operation. In March, Beijing mediated a landmark agreement between the kingdom and Iran, helping to ease regional tensions. Saudi Arabia has also significantly strengthened its energy ties with China. The Saudis are expected to emerge as another financially reliable shareholder in the NDB as the international lender assesses its ability to mobilize funds.

"26 May, 2023",Most wanted Rwandan genocide fugitive appears in court,"Fulgence Kayishema, 62, was arrested in South Africa on Wednesday after being on the run for almost three decades Former Rwandan police officer Fulgence Kayishema, a long-time fugitive arrested this week for his alleged role in the killing of some 2,000 Tutsis during the 1994 genocide, was arraigned before the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Friday. Kayishema is facing five charges in South Africa, including two counts of fraud for breaching the Immigration Act and one for violating the Refugees Act. The fraud charges have been linked to his asylum and refugee applications, in which he allegedly used a false name and claimed to be Burundian, according to Reuters, citing the court charge sheet. The suspect reportedly did not enter a plea during the court proceedings. He has been remanded in custody, with the case adjourned to June 2. According to local media, Eric Ntabazalila, the National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson, said the state was opposed to bail. Kayishema, 62, was arrested on Wednesday on a grape farm in Paarl, near Cape Town, in a joint operation by UN investigators and the South African authorities after being on the run for almost 30 years. The UN s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said he was ""one of the world s most wanted genocide fugitives,"" indicted in 2001 for directly participating in the planning and execution of the massacre of refugees hiding at the Nyange Catholic Church in Kivumu on April 15, 1994. He had a $5 million bounty on his head through the US State Department's Rewards for Justice Program. Some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the genocide, which lasted 100 days between April and July 1994. Kayishema reportedly told journalists in court on Friday that he did not play any role in the violence. ""What I can say? We are sorry to hear what was happening,"" he was quoted by Reuters as saying. He will be held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town pending possible extradition to Rwanda.

"25 May, 2023",South Africa s ruling party says Putin welcome despite ICC warrant,"The country is still constrained by the institution, a top party official has admitted South Africa s ruling African National Congress (ANC) is ready to greet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the country at any time, the party s secretary-general, Fikile Mbalula, has said. The senior party official made the remarks in an interview with BBC HARDtalk s host Stephen Sackur, who asked him whether he believed the country s government would actually enforce the arrest warrant against Putin that was issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) earlier this year. If it were according to the ANC, we would want President Putin to be here, even tomorrow, to come to our country, Mbalula stated, noting, however, that we know that we re constrained by the ICC in terms of doing that. The official somewhat avoided answering the question directly, suggesting it is not actually possible to simply go and arrest the leader of a country. Putin is the head of state, do you think that a head of state can just be arrested anywhere? Mbalula went on, adding that the Russian president has actually been working for peace between Ukraine and Russia. He also pressed the reporter over the questionable record of the UK itself and its Western allies, particularly former British PM Tony Blair, as well as the futile search for the weapons of mass destruction used as a pretext to invade Iraq. How many crimes has your country committed in Iraq? How many crimes has everyone else who s so vocal today committed in Iraq and Afghanistan? Have you arrested them? The remarks prompted Sackur to wrap up the discussion on the topic, with the journalist switching to questions about South African domestic affairs instead. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the presidential commissioner for children s rights, in mid-March, accusing them of taking part in the unlawful deportation of the population (children) and that of the unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. The Hague-based tribunal is not recognized by Moscow, and the move has no legal validity in Russia. However, the ICC move cast a shadow over the upcoming BRICS summit, which is scheduled for August and hosted by South Africa. The country s officials have produced mixed signals on the prospect of enforcing the warrant. In mid-April, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa even pledged to leave the ICC altogether, but he backtracked shortly thereafter, with his office claiming the president had made the remarks erroneously. The warrant caused widespread condemnation in Russia and triggered legal action against the tribunal s officials. This week, Russia s Investigative Committee charged in absentia a prosecutor and an ICC judge with making false accusations against a foreign official under international protection in order to complicate international relations.

"25 May, 2023",Google removes Slavery Simulator media,"The game was withdrawn one month after its launch in the tech giant's online store Google has removed a game from its online store in Brazil which allowed players to trade and torture enslaved people, following criticism from figures in the South American country who say the US tech giant and the game s developer should be held to account. The game called Slavery Simulator casts the player in the role of a slave owner who can buy and sell black characters, and inflict various forms of torture on them. It was withdrawn from Google s online store in Brazil on Wednesday, a little over a month after its release, but remains playable for the more than 1,000 people who downloaded it over the past four weeks, according to the Brazilian publication Globo. One review of the game in the Google Play store describes it as excellent to pass the time but lacking more torture options. The game has prompted an outcry in Brazil. Blatant racism, Renata Souza, a black activist and politician in Rio de Janeiro, tweeted on Wednesday. The image illustrating the game has a white man surrounded by black men. It is absurdly violent. Google and the developer must answer for this crime of hatred and racism. Brazil s ministry for racial equality said it has contacted the developer, Magnus Games, as well as Google to implement measures to restrict racist content online. It added that the people behind the game will be held legally responsible, the Guardian reported on Thursday. The racial equality ministry reiterates its irreversible commitment to eliminating racial inequalities and promoting policies that curb the dissemination of racist content online, in football stadiums, and in society as a whole, the governmental body said in a statement this week, referencing the abuse directed at Brazilian footballer Vinicius Junior during a recent game in Spain. The legislature in the South American country is currently considering proposals which aim to require social media companies to implement measures to reduce criminal or dangerous content spread by their platforms. This comes after tech companies in Brazil including its Google office were criticized for a failure to adequately moderate racist or criminal content. Brazil is estimated to have transported around 4 million slaves from Africa before it implemented the so-called Golden Law in 1888 which abolished slavery in all forms.

Fulgence Kayishema, 62, who is said to have been on the run for more than two decades, was apprehended in Paarl on Wednesday in a joint operation by UN investigators and the South African authorities. He was indicted by the UN s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 2001 for helping to orchestrate the murder of more than 2,000 Tutsi refugees including women, children, and the elderly on April 15, 1994, at the Nyange Catholic Church in Kivumu community. According to the tribunal, Kayishema, a Hutu police inspector at the time, directly participated in the planning and execution of this massacre. He allegedly bought and distributed petrol to burn down the church while the refugees were inside, as well as using a bulldozer to collapse the structure, burying and killing the victims inside. He had remained at large since his indictment, using many aliases and false documents to conceal his identity and presence, investigators stated. Fulgence Kayishema was a fugitive for more than 20 years. His arrest ensures that he will finally face justice for his alleged crimes, the chief prosecutor of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT), Serge Brammertz, said in a statement. The operation leading to the suspect s arrest spanned multiple countries across Africa and other regions, the office of the IRMCT said. His capture leaves investigators with three outstanding fugitives to track down. Kayishema s arrest marks a further step forward in the OTP s [Office of the Prosecutor] strategy to account for all remaining fugitives indicted for genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Since 2020, the OTP Fugitive Tracking Team has accounted for the whereabouts of five fugitives, the IRMCT stated. On May 10, a 66-year-old former military police officer from Rwanda, Philippe Hategekimana, was put on trial in France, accused of participating in the slaughter of 300 Tutsis on Nyamugari Hill and in an attack on Nyabubare Hill, where approximately 1,000 Tutsis were killed during the 100-day genocide. Brammertz has vowed that the IRMCT will not relent in its efforts to secure justice for the victims and carry out its mandate to contribute to a more just and peaceful future for the Rwandan people.

"25 May, 2023",The G7 is an outdated tool of the US neo-empire,"Washington has co-opted both winners and losers of World War II into defending Western domination around the globe ByTimur Fomenko, a political analyst The summit of G7 nations took place in Hiroshima, Japan over the last weekend. Hiroshima is significant for a few reasons. First of all, it is known to the world as the location that the United States nuked, along with Nagasaki, at the end of World War II, which led to the surrender of the Empire of Japan and that country s transformation into a US client state. Secondly, Japan is working to remilitarize itself in line with America s dual containment effort against China and Russia. Thus, while Japan is chair of the G7 this year, the event was a rubber-stamping of US-centric geopolitical goals which took aim at both countries. However, what might be said about the G7 itself? Founded as a Cold War-era organization in 1975, and briefly incorporating the West s aspirations for post-Soviet Russia, the group professes to represent the world s most advanced industrial countries, but anyone could tell you this is an outdated category. Countries such as China and India, with economies larger than most G7 members, are not part of the group. Rather, the character and agenda of the G7 is distinctly ideological, and its goal is to preserve a Western-dominated concept of the world at all costs. It should not go unnoticed that the G7 is an effective aggregation of former empires that once dominated the world unchallenged, now held under the wings and servitude of the US. Remarkably, all three Axis powers of World War II, defeated by the allies, are a part of this grouping. Although the respective fascist-oriented regimes of Germany, Italy and Japan were rightfully destroyed, these countries were all rebuilt as American client states following the war and their respective interests placed in the hands of Washington. Similarly, the allied empires, which emerged victorious, including France, Britain and its imperial dominion, Canada, found that the war had severely depleted their national resources and strength to the point they could no longer continue as the global superpowers they had been. Consequently, they surrendered their leadership baton to the US and have ever since relied on following its lead to secure their interests around the world. In each instance, all of these countries held positions of privilege from their imperial eras. Having colonized most of the globe, and Japan having militarily occupied much of Asia, these countries had made themselves tremendously wealthy. Britain s fabulous wealth, for one, is tailored directly to the exploitation of Africa and India. Colonial empires were strictly commercial in character, using ideology as a justifying force for aggression, upholding their economic interests by immense military power. This gave these countries privilege, which thus formed the distinction between the Global North and the Global South. Unable to carry their empires forward, either by exhaustion or defeat, these respective countries seek to sustain the unfair economic privileges they attained through compliance with the US, a neo-empire which is the inheritor of the international order they created. Thus, the G7, the aggregation of all these countries into one ideological grouping, is no coincidence. Their respective goal is to maintain their own economic privileges and to attempt to suppress changes in the international order that threaten their position, which in this case is the rise of the Global South and China. On this note, the G7 buys into the US-led goals of attempting to blockade China from making breakthroughs in high-end technologies. It also wants to stop other countries from buying into Beijing s development model and to sustain the fundamental gulf in wealth between the Global North and South. It wants to be the only group entitled to impose massive sanctions and embargoes on other countries and then decry China s defense of its interests as economic coercion. They also want to make sure that neither China nor Russia can challenge the West s historic military dominance. The US has thus in effect co-opted both the winners and losers of World War II (minus the USSR) into one grouping and used it to continue the same world they were vested in. However, one undeniable fact is that the world is changing in ways that are not favorable to the G7. They no longer have that degree of dominance, and their share of global GDP is only going to shrink. As the BRICS economies continue to grow and multipolarity emerges, their own little exclusive club is hardly in a position to try and dictate the flow of the global economy. This little club wants to remain rich, while stopping everyone else from enriching themselves as well. It isn t going to work. ",https://www.rt.com/news/576841-g7-us-imperial-goals/

We value historically strong, friendly, truly trusting ties with the states of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and we will strengthen them in every possible way, Putin added.

As a result of those actions, the level of instability is growing on the international scene, Putin noted. In different regions, old hotspots are expanding and new ones emerge... The people in many nations are experiencing dramatic consequences of coups, organized from the outside, he said. However, the president insisted that Russia is confident there is an alternative to the Western policy of blackmail and illegal sanctions.

Why is the UN, which was started with the idea of establishing peace, not successful in preventing conflicts today? Modi addressed G7 leaders in Hiroshima on Sunday. The institutions created in the last century are not in line with the system of the 21st century, he continued, adding that they do not reflect the realities of the present. That is why it is necessary that reforms should be implemented in big institutions like the UN, he stated. They will also have to become the voice of the Global South. Otherwise, we will only keep talking about ending the conflicts. The UN and the Security Council will remain just a talk shop. The Security Council consists of 15 members, ten of which serve two-year terms on the body and cannot veto resolutions. Formed in 1945, the Security Council can enforce sanctions, authorize military action, and refer cases for the International Criminal Court but only with the unanimous consent of the five permanent members. These five nations the US, UK, China, France, and Russia were the first five states to acquire nuclear weapons, and the veto system and its resulting deadlock was largely engineered to prevent them from engaging in nuclear war with one another. India has since acquired its own atomic weapons, and along with Brazil, Germany, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, is considered a leading candidate to join an expanded Security Council as a permanent member. Russia has advocated for a more diverse Security Council for years, with Moscow s permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, telling the council last year that it can be democratized only through increasing the representation of African, Asian, and Latin American states.

Exports of Russian petroleum to India surged by 4.4% on a monthly basis to 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in April compared to 928,400 bpd imported by New Delhi from Iraq and 723,800 bpd delivered from Saudi Arabia, the figures showed. Asia s third biggest economy, which is also the world s third-largest oil importer and consumer, ramped up oil purchases after Russia rerouted supplies to Asia in response to Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia remained the top oil supplier to the South Asian nation for the sixth straight month in April, followed by Iraq, traditionally India s top supplier, and Saudi Arabia. Growing oil imports from Russia also pushed up the share of crude from Commonwealth of Independent States members, including Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, to 43.6% of an overall 4.81 million bpd imported by India last month.

Zuma initiated the private case against Ramaphosa in December, accusing him of being an accessory after the fact to a crime allegedly committed by state prosecutor Billy Downer and journalist Karyn Maughan. The case alleges that Downer gave Maughan a copy of Zuma s medical records, which were later disclosed in court. Zuma claims Ramaphosa failed to act on Downer s alleged breach. Ramaphosa is now seeking an urgent interim interdict against Zuma, preventing the case from going any further, arguing that it is purely political. An attorney for Zuma argued in court on Thursday that President Ramaphosa could not claim urgency in the case since he did not promptly seek legal recourse when he received the summons. A lawyer for Ramaphosa, Ngwako Maenetje, called the charges frivolous and vexatious, adding that the courts are not there to settle political scores or to deal with personal animosity.

"18 May, 2023",South Africa to produce HIV-prevention drug,"Indian firm Cipla Limited will produce an affordable version of the product at its plants in Benoni or Durban South Africa is set to become a manufacturing hub for an affordable version of the innovative HIV-prevention drug CAP-LA. The move is expected to provide millions of people with access to the drug in a region that the World Health Organization (WHO) says accounts for almost two-thirds of new HIV infections globally. The drug, cabotegravir long-acting (LA), will be produced by Cipla Limited, an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company, at its plants in Benoni or Durban, The Guardian reported on Thursday. Last year, the WHO described CAB-LA as a safe and highly effective prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection. The drug is said to block HIV from entering cells, massively reducing the risk of infection, and has been proven by research to reduce the chances of contracting the virus through sex. The developers of the drug, Viiv Healthcare and the United Nations-backed public health organization Medicines Patent Pool, said sublicense agreements to produce the generic version were signed with Aurobindo, Cipla, and Viatris in March. In a statement on its website at the time, the MPP said the selected manufacturers will be able to develop and supply generic versions in 90 countries subject to required regulatory approvals being obtained. The drug is provided as an injection administered six times per year and is initiated with a single 600mg (3ml) jab given one month apart for two consecutive months, according to the MPP. However, a person must have a negative HIV-1 test prior to receiving it. In South Africa, ViiV Healthcare holds the patent for CAB-LA until 2031, limiting competition. Viiv also announced that it has received regulatory approval for use of the drug in the United States, Australia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Malawi for at-risk adults and adolescents.

Details of the endeavor are still being finalized but their mission could take place in early June, Bloomberg reported. The six heads of state will be shuttling between the two capitals to engage in the facilitating of peace talks, to at least get toward a cease-fire, said Department of International Relations and Cooperation Director-General Zane Dangor. In a virtual meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday, Dangor stated that the initiative has already been shared with the UN secretary-general, who is supporting it. We have also engaged with other actors, including the US. There is general support for this initiative that President Ramaphosa announced, he said. Dangor also noted that Naledi Pandor, South Africa s foreign minister, will meet her Ukrainian counterpart in Portugal in the coming days to discuss the African initiative. The official s statement comes after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Tuesday that the leaders of Egypt, Uganda, Zambia, Senegal and the Republic of the Congo had expressed their willingness to take part in the peace initiative and that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky had agreed to host the mission. South Africa a member of the BRICS group along with Brazil, Russia, India and China is among the countries that have refused to take part in the US-led campaign to sanction Moscow over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

He noted, however, that Western nations don t appear to be as open-minded and only seem to acknowledge President Zelensky s ten-step peace plan, which involves the capitulation of Russia, a tribunal against the Russian leadership, and reparations for Ukraine.

Moscow has denied those allegations, and has accused the US and UK of derailing the negotiations.

"17 May, 2023",Moscow and Tehran sign key rail deal,"The new route will help diversify international trade flows, according to President Putin Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi have taken part in a signing ceremony, via video link, for an agreement on the construction of a rail line between the Iranian cities of Rasht and Astara, the Kremlin press service reported on Wednesday. The railroad linking the two cities is part of the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-kilometer multi-mode transit system that connects ship, rail, and road routes for moving cargo between India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe. The $1.6 billion contract to build the Rasht-Astara rail line, a project in northern Iran which will serve as a key cargo transit route within the INSTC system, was signed by Russian Transport Minister Vitaly Savelyev and Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mehrdad Bazrpash. ""The unique North-South transport artery, of which the Rasht-Astara railway will become a part, will help to significantly diversify global traffic flows. Transportation along the new corridor will have significant competitive advantages,""the Russian president said. Putin added that the route will substantially cut travel times and costs, and help develop new logistics chains. The 162-kilometer railway will connect the city of Rasht, near the Caspian Sea, to Astara on the border with Azerbaijan. Once completed, it will allow the transport of cargo from the Persian Gulf to the Finnish capital, Helsinki, via the Russian city of Saint Petersburg. Putin also noted that the new rail section will make a tangible contribution to ensuring global food security. ""The new highway is intended to be used, among other things, for the transportation of food and other products of the agro-industrial complex, which will be intended both for consumers in Iran and for the countries of the Persian Gulf and Africa,""the Russian president explained. Analysts have said the North-South corridor could become a safe alternative to the Suez Canal to protect trade flows from geopolitical fallout. Existing transport infrastructure has been historically focused on the East-West connection, but new routes are gaining prominence due to global shifts in world markets towards China, South-East Asia and the Persian Gulf. The construction of the INSTC began in the early 2000s, but efforts to develop it have intensified in light of Western sanctions, targeting both Russia and Iran. The restrictions have forced Moscow to shift its trade flows from Europe to Asia, Africa and the Middle East. ",https://www.rt.com/business/576438-iran-russia-railway-construction-deal/

"16 May, 2023",Namibia grants legal status to certain same-sex marriages,"Homosexual unions legally concluded abroad must be recognized by the government, the Supreme Court has ruled Namibia s Supreme Court on Tuesday granted legal recognition to same-sex marriages concluded abroad between Namibian citizens and foreign spouses. The move overturns a previous High Court ruling that refused to accept such unions. Two Namibian citizens took legal action when the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration declined to issue permits to their same-sex foreign partners. The couples, Daniel Digashu and Johan Potgieter, and Anette and Anita Seiler-Lilles, who married in South Africa and Germany respectively, had argued that the term spouse in Namibian immigration law should be inclusive of same-sex couples or be declared unconstitutional. The High Court, however, ruled against them last year. While the judge presiding over the case agreed with their argument, she stated that she was bound by Namibia s prohibition of same-sex relations and that only the Supreme Court can correct the situation. However, local media reported on Tuesday that the Supreme Court declared that same-sex marriages between the two gay couples must be acknowledged in Namibia, with the non-Namibian partners recognized as spouses under the Immigration Control Act. The court emphasized that the Ministry of Home Affairs refusal to acknowledge these marriages violates constitutional rights to equality and dignity. This court accordingly found that the approach of the ministry to exclude spouses, including the appellants, in a validly concluded same-sex marriage... infringes both the interrelated rights to dignity and equality of the appellants, the ruling said, as reported by AFP. The decision also grants non-Namibian spouses in same-sex marriages the same residency rights in Namibia as heterosexual couples. In March, the Supreme Court of Namibia overturned a lower court s decision to grant citizenship to the son of a gay couple who was born to a surrogate mother in South Africa, where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2006. The court refused to grant nationality to four-year-old Yona, who had Phillip Luhl, a Namibian, and his Mexican partner, Guillermo Delgado, listed as his parents on the South African birth certificate. The ruling insisted that Yona s birth was not registered in accordance with the Citizenship Act. Although homosexuality is illegal in Namibia, the 1927 sodomy law is rarely enforced.

During a press briefing on Tuesday, Ramaphosa revealed he had talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky about the proposal. My discussions with the two leaders demonstrated that they are both ready to receive the African leaders and to have a discussion on how this conflict can be brought to an end, Ramaphosa said, as cited by Reuters. Whether that will succeed or not is going to depend on the discussions that will be held, he added. South Africa, which is part of the BRICS group of nations along with Brazil, Russia, India, and China, is among the countries that have refused to join the US-led campaign to sanction Moscow in response to the hostilities in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ramaphosa noted that South Africa had a tradition of non-alignment stemming from the Cold War. Throughout, we have been firm on this point: South Africa has not been, and will not be, drawn into a contest between global powers, the president said. In his announcement on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said the leaders of Senegal, Uganda, and Egypt had agreed to participate in the initiative.

Several nations, including China, Brazil, and Turkiye, have offered assistance as mediators between Moscow and Kiev. However, Ukraine and its Western backers have insisted that Zelensky s peace plan is the only viable path to resolve the conflict. The Ukrainian proposal, which has been firmly rejected by Moscow, boils down to Russia conceding defeat, withdrawing from territories Kiev claims as its own, and paying reparations. Ukraine also envisages assistance from the international community for reconstruction and security. The Russian government perceives the conflict in Ukraine as part of a wider proxy war waged against it by the US and its allies, as they seek to protect their hegemony from an emerging multipolar world.

"15 May, 2023",EU approves Microsoft s revised Activision takeover bid,"The EU has given Microsoft the green light to acquire Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, the European Commission announced on Monday, countering opposition to the deal from both UK and US regulators. The acquisition would put Microsoft in control of top-earning franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and the Candy Crush Saga. The EC s decision explained Microsoft had fully addressed the regulator s concerns about anti-competitiveness found during its investigation of the proposed deal by offering to provide free ten year licenses to European gamers who wanted to stream Activision games on non-Microsoft cloud gaming services. The investigation had originally determined the deal would have harmed competition in both the distribution of console and PC video games and the supply of PC operating systems. Specifically, if Microsoft made Activision s games exclusive to its Game Pass Ultimate cloud streaming service, gamers would have fewer reasons to use other services; while, if Microsoft hobbled the streaming of Activision games on non-Windows operating systems, gamers would move away from those. The EC s proposed remedy required that the company guarantee gamers right to stream all Activision games with any cloud game streaming platform, onto any device, using any operating system. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager reasoned Microsoft s proposal was close enough, arguing the move would bring Activision s games to many more devices and consumers than before thanks to cloud game streaming. While the European and UK regulators agreed the original deal was both unlikely to warp the wider market for console games and a significant hazard to competition within the niche market of cloud gaming, the two disagreed on whether Microsoft s revisions sufficiently addressed that threat. The UK s Competition and Markets Authority, which blocked the transaction last month, slammed Microsoft s concessions as another form of anti-competitive manipulation, suggesting they would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next ten years. The very act of making such promises would set an example that future competitors would have to follow, the CMA reasoned, especially because the cloud gaming market was new and changing rapidly. Microsoft has appealed the CMA s decision. Meanwhile, in the US, the Federal Trade Commission is also suing to block the deal, and unless Microsoft can win over one of the two, it is unlikely to go forward despite winning the confidence of smaller regulators in Brazil, Japan, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.

"15 May, 2023",Some nations see double standards on Russia Scholz,"Germany s chancellor has acknowledged the viewpoint that Western powers don t apply their principles equally India, Vietnam and other countries that have balked at condemning Russia over its conflict with Ukraine largely agree with the principles behind the Western-based international order, but they aren t convinced that those tenets are being applied fairly to Moscow, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has admitted. When I talk to leaders from those countries, many assure me that they are not questioning the underlying principles of our international order. What they are struggling with is the unequal application of those principles, Scholz saidon Monday at the Global Solutions Summit in Berlin. United Nations members voted overwhelmingly last October to demand that Russian forces immediately withdraw from Ukraine, but dozens of countries either opposed the resolution or abstained. In addition to India and Vietnam, such nations as China, South Africa, Algeria and Pakistan voted to abstain. Those countries have largely resisted US pressure to join in a Western-led sanctions campaign against Russia. What they expect is representation on equal terms and an end to Western double standards, Scholz conceded. He added that cooperation from those influential nations will be limited at best if their leaders perceive that we only approach them because we are interested in their raw materials or because we want their support on a UN resolution. Scholz claimed that perceptions of Western geopolitical hypocrisy aren t always justified. But we must address them if we want to encourage powers in Asia, Africa and the Americas to join us in building and defending a stable global order. He suggested that offering developing nations a bigger voice in international affairs would help earn their cooperation. For instance, he has supported giving African nations permanent representation on the UN Security Council and making the African Union a permanent G20 member. Russian officials have often accused the US and its Western allies of demanding that their rules be followed without doing so themselves. For instance, Washington only advocates the principles of self-determination and respect for territorial integrity when they fit its interests, Russian diplomats have argued. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed out in March that Washington had ignored Moscow s security concerns in neighboring Ukraine after justifying America s faraway military interventions in such countries as Syria, Libya, and Serbia by claiming that its national interests were threatened. In a word, if this is not what you call a double standard, then I am not foreign minister, Lavrov said. ",https://www.rt.com/news/576351-germany-scholz-western-double-standards-on-russia/
"15 May, 2023",Igor Makarov: G20 policy advisors are tired of America s self-serving rules-based international order ,"The Global South is starting to question whether Western countries, and primarily the US, should be allowed to continue dictating the international agenda ByIgor Makarov, Associate Professor at the Higher School of Economics (HSE), head of the Research and Educational Laboratory for the Economics of Climate Change, and the editor-in-chief of HSE s Contemporary World Economy Last week, in Mumbai, I attended the Think 20 interim conference. It describes itself as an idea bank for the G20 that brings together think tanks and high-level experts to discuss policy issues relevant to the group. The recommendations involved are far from trivial. The world is in a series of simultaneous structural crises right now: the economy, debt levels, sustainable development goals and, separately, climate change. Above all, it is also engulfed in a crisis of global governance, the basic architecture of which was developed in a different era (when there was a different balance of power between countries, in which they had different objectives). The main target of criticism were international financial institutions. The problem is not so much the effectiveness with which they are run by developed countries (although this has also been much debated), but that they are not up to the task of pooling large amounts of money for common purposes. The world has sufficient financial resources to address many sustainable development issues, but they cannot be directed to where they are needed. For example, the cost of capital in the developed (mostly Western) world has averaged 1.5-2% over the past five years, but it has been at 8% in Asia, 16% in Africa and 22% in sub-Saharan Africa. Tightening monetary policy in the West only exacerbates the situation for developing countries. The role of international financial institutions is not so much to provide aid to poor states but to help channel sufficient private savings around the world into development projects, taking on some of the risks of investors. India, as it happens, complains that the World Bank has provided only peanuts in funding (just a few billion dollars), relative to its over $3 trillion economy, in nominal US dollar terms. The second necessity is digitization. The focus is on digitizing services and public infrastructure (as opposed to the manner in which it can be used for industry in the US and Europe). An example of how this can work is the digital ID system being developed in India, which is linked to a bank account. As a result, there are now four times more digital transactions in the South Asian country than in China, and 11 times more than in the US and Western Europe combined. The aim is twofold: to make it easier to include more people (especially women) in economic activity, and to stimulate innovation. Developing countries will be less and less able to host Western industries (which was the Chinese growth model), so innovation will have to be built up through services, especially as new technologies will allow global companies to outsource more and more. Multilateralism is essential. However, the question is to what extent the US, on the one hand, and China, on the other, are ready for it. The former is more interested in the results of its next election, and the cycle itself, than in global problems; while the latter sees its participation in solving them so far only in the form of China-centric formats such as the Belt and Road Initiative. There was one attempt to attack Russia for undermining a well-functioning world order by an Anglo-American participant, who was immediately rebuked rather harshly by a Brazilian and then an Indian moderator. In general, any talk of a rule-based order in Mumbai was visibly tiresome. In just a few years, I have seen a clear shift from delegates declaring the crisis of this kind of order to key people asking who should actually make the rules. The general impression is that the successive presidencies of Indonesia, India, Brazil and South Africa, from 2022-2025, (with very active interaction between them) of the G20 will be maximized by these countries to shape a new narrative, which of course will not automatically translate into reforms of global governance, but will serve as constant pressure for these changes.

"15 May, 2023",Ten lions killed in Kenyan human-wildlife conflict ,"The animals were targeted by herders in retaliation for attacking 11 goats and a dog, officials said Six lions were killed on Saturday in Kenya s Amboseli National Park in what authorities have described as a human-wildlife conflict. The wild animals were reportedly speared to death after they attacked livestock, in a blow to the country s conservation efforts. This is not an isolated incident, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said, adding that over the last week, four other lions have been killed, resulting in a total of ten lions killed in the Amboseli ecosystem. According to the KWS, the killings were carried out by herders after the lions attacked 11 goats and a dog in Kajiado South Sub County, in a country where human-wildlife conflict is a frequent problem. The KWS said it met with community members to discuss ways to find lasting solutions to the issue, including developing early warning systems to alert communities to the presence of wildlife. The aim of the discussions is to determine ways of balancing the needs of the local communities with the need to protect wildlife. While pledging to safeguard Kenya s wildlife, which it described as a vital component of the nation s heritage, the service urged the public to report instances of wild animal attacks to the KWS. The latest killings come days after Loonkiito, an iconic 19-year-old male lion believed to be the world s oldest in the wild, was speared to death after straying into a livestock pen on the outskirts of the famed Amboseli National Park. In 2021, the KWS described Loonkiito as a legendary big cat warrior who had defended his territory for over a decade. It was an old lion that had issues getting prey on its own and livestock is easy prey, KWS spokesman Paul Jinaro told AFP, adding that a normal lion would go for wildlife inside the park. Lion Guardian, a conservation organization dedicated to finding and enacting long-term solutions for human-wildlife coexistence, eulogized Loonkiito as a symbol of resilience and coexistence. The Amboseli National Park is a significant tourist attraction and home to many prized game, including elephants, cheetahs, buffaloes, and giraffes. There are approximately 2,500 lions in Kenya, according to the country s first-ever national wildlife census in 2021. In July 2021, a lion caused panic in a crowded Nairobi neighborhood during rush hour after leaving Nairobi National Park, located just 7km from the city center. Incidents of wild animals escaping the park and entering the city have occurred before, including a fatal attack by a lion on a man just outside the park in December 2019, while another lion was shot dead in March 2016 after attacking and injuring a resident.

However, much like other African nations, South Africa has come under extraordinary pressure to change its long-standing approach since the start of Russia s military campaign against Ukraine, the leader stated. Ramaphosa insisted that South Africa s neutrality does not amount to support for Russia. We do not accept that our non-aligned position favors Russia above other countries. Nor do we accept that it should imperil our relations with other countries, he argued. Pretoria s position is that Kiev and Moscow should sit at the negotiating table and resolve their differences politically, Ramaphosa added. His statement lamented the weaknesses in the structure and practices of the United Nations, which he claimed have been highlighted by the conflict. The South African leader also called for an overhaul of the UN Security Council, asserting that its makeup is not representative of the current global landscape. Speaking in parliament last Wednesday, South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor warned that conflicts between major global powers pose a threat to all the smaller economies of the world. She concluded by saying that today s world is not the world many hoped for when the Cold War ended. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/576326-south-africa-president-russia-west-conflict/
"15 May, 2023",Southern African nations agree to deploy troops to DR Congo,"SADC forces will join the East African regional military force to fight the M23 rebel militia Southern African countries will deploy troops to the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in an effort to end violence sparked by armed groups that have been terrorizing civilians in the mineral-rich region for years. This decision was made last week during a summit of the 16-member Southern African Development Community (SADC), which includes countries such as South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, and Tanzania. SADC troops will join the East African regional military force that has been present in several areas previously controlled by the M23 militia since December 2022. However, the insurgency has continued in the North Kivu province, where the Tutsi-led rebels occasionally clash with rival militias. The arrival of SADC forces in Beni, North Kivu, was met with optimism by some residents who said they have been devastated by brutal killings. For years we have been suffering from war night and day. People are being killed. SADC is coming to help us. We cannot chase them away or refuse to let them come. We will listen to them as we do to others who continue to fight against the rebels, a local told RT. Also speaking to RT, Jeroboam Shaanika, executive director at the Namibian Ministry of International Relations, said the SADC is working to ensure peace and stability in order to attain deeper integration. He added that this cannot be attained if there are conflicts in parts of the region, and that is why this conflict has to be brought to an end. The United Nations has said the ongoing violence has affected education for more than 600,000 children in North Kivu, as well uprooting more than 800,000 people in a country where more than 6 million are internally displaced. At least 97 civilians were killed by rebel groups in early March of this year, according to the UN. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/576307-sadc-troops-drc-rebel-militias/
"15 May, 2023",Row with US won t lead to sanctions South Africa official,"Pretoria has settled its dispute with Washington regarding claims that it supplied arms to Russia, the finance minister has said South Africa has resolved its dispute with the US over allegations that Pretoria supplied weapons to Russia, the finance minister has said. The Americans are not likely to respond with any anger tomorrow, Enoch Godongwana told Bloomberg in an interview published on Sunday. The US ambassador to South Africa, Ruben Brigety, accused Pretoria last week of providing arms to Russia by loading them onto a cargo ship in Simon s Town naval base in Cape Town in December, which the South African government has denied. Godongwana said the Americans first expressed their concerns about the matter two months ago, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation and send a delegation to Washington to ease tensions. A number of actions were taken in order to ensure that our relationship with the US remains and that relationship should be normal and cordial, the minister was quoted by Bloomberg as saying. The issue has reportedly caused concern among investors, with the rand and government bond yields plummeting amid fears that a diplomatic escalation might put billions of dollars in trade at risk. Godongwana said that the market s reaction could disrupt South Africa s fiscal framework, but a recovery would depend on investors confidence that the issue is resolved. Once people realize that the matters raised by the ambassador have been dealt with, I think that things are going to stabilize, he said. Relations between Pretoria and Washington have deteriorated as South Africa insists on taking a non-aligned stance towards the Ukraine conflict. Brigety s comments worsened the tensions, and the South African government expressed its displeasure with his conduct. The envoy was summoned to explain his remarks, and he apologized unreservedly for crossing the line. All weapons sales in South Africa, according to Godongwana, have to be approved by a cabinet committee, and no official decision had been made to supply Russia. If it did happen as the Americans claim, it could be a conduct of people who were mischief makers, he said. People who have got that information must provide that information to the judge so that we can take the necessary action, he added. Unlike many Western countries, South Africa which, along with Russia, Brazil, India, and China, forms the BRICS group of nations has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow and supply weapons to Ukraine. Ramaphosa has explained that his country s neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine conflict means we can talk to both sides. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/576312-south-africa-us-weapon-row/

"14 May, 2023",China cutting back on purchases of US corn Bloomberg,"The top importer of the crop is turning to Brazil Major US corn buyer China has been reducing imports from the country due to weak demand and cheaper supplies from Brazil, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Chinese buyers have reportedly canceled 832,000 tons of US corn orders in the past three weeks, while ramping up purchases from fellow BRICS member Brazil, which is projected to pass the US as the top exporter this year. According to the report, citing traders, US corn is now less competitive, with supplies from Brazil around $30 a ton cheaper for delivery in the third quarter. Weak domestic demand for corn as animal feed was also listed among the reasons behind the cancelations. Demand for corn is really poor, Wang Xiaoyang, a senior analyst with Sinolink Futures in one of the top grain-growing provinces, Henan, told Bloomberg. Feed producers are using a lot of wheat to replace corn as prices keep falling. The report indicated that wheat prices are around 180 yuan ($26) a ton cheaper than corn in Henan and may decline further.Meanwhile, traders and analysts pointed out that struggling hog farmers are seeking to cut feed costs, so replacing corn with wheat is a natural choice. Customs data shows that Chinese corn imports hit a record of over 28 million tons in 2021, before falling to about 21 million tons last year. China is reportedly seeking to shift away from its heavy reliance on the US and Ukraine for corn by diversifying suppliers, amid geopolitical uncertainty threatening the country s food security. This month, China also received its first shipload of feed corn from South Africa, another fellow member of BRICS. ",https://www.rt.com/business/576165-china-us-corn-brazil/

According to him, funding for extracting minerals used in renewable energy projects will have to come from international investors who want to grow in the renewable space or play a role in the renewable space or in the mining of those critical minerals. He added that African banks will not be able to finance such projects on their own. Energy analysts say renewable power could help solve a severe energy crisis Africans have been facing for decades. Some 600 million people about half of the continent s population currently don t even have access to electricity. It is not possible for Africa and many of the African countries to ignore the shortage of electricity supply, Fihla said in a separate interview with Bloomberg. At the same time, Africa holds all the necessary resources for green energy projects, from solar panels to electric vehicle batteries. Minerals such as copper and cobalt can be found in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, platinum and manganese seams in South Africa, and lithium deposits in Zimbabwe. Many of the minerals that are required to build solar panels, lithium batteries, wind turbines and so on, are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Fihla confirmed. Our team has also quantified the amount of investment that is required in that space as in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars. Standard Bank, which is Africa s largest lender by assets, expects to reach the upper end of lending between 250 billion rand ($13.25 billion) and 300 billion ($15.88 billion) for renewable energy by 2026, Fihla said.

This airspace is a vital corridor between Russia and its military bases in Syria. Multiple American officials asked Cairo in February and March to declare its skies off limits to Russian military aircraft, the newspaperreported, citing US and Egyptian officials. Egypt has not responded to these requests, and flights between Syria and Russia have reportedly continued unimpeded. Asked by the Wall Street Journal, a US State Department official declined to comment on private diplomatic conversations. Situated on Syria s Mediterranean coast, Khmeimim Air Base is one of Russia s most important military facilities in Syria. With Iraq, Jordan, and Turkiye blocking most Russian military flights since last year at the US request, Russian aircraft must now fly south over Azerbaijan and Iran, west over Saudi Arabia, and finally back north over Egypt before landing at Khmeimim. Without permission to fly over Egypt, Russia would be forced to seek a new and far longer route over Africa to reach its forces in Syria by air. Meanwhile, Turkiye s closure of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to military vessels last year has complicated the movement of arms and equipment by sea. American officials believe that Moscow is moving weapons from Syria to the battlefield in Ukraine, although this has not been confirmed or denied by the Russian side. Discounting Ukraine, Egypt is the second-largest recipient of US military aid in the world, receiving about $1.3 billion a year from Washington. Despite only Israel receiving more direct military support from the US, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has not completely aligned his foreign policy with that of Washington. Al Sisi has deployed troops in Libya and ordered airstrikes against the US-recognized Government of National Accord, all while funding the opposing Libyan National Army, which was aided on the battlefield by Russian military contractors. The Egyptian president has a cordial relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the country has adopted a neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine. According to recently leaked Pentagon documents, however, Al Sisi recentlydroppeda plan to supply arms to Russia and instead agreed to supply the US with artillery ammunition for Kiev s forces.

The violence comes amid weeks of fighting between rival military factions in the capital Khartoum, with the UN on Thursday calling for an end to the conflict. Speaking to RT on Friday, local reporter Abdallah Hussein said the governor of the Kosti region had imposed a curfew in the White Nile state, which stretches from Khartoum to the border close to South Sudan.

It s a matter we must discuss and discuss properly, Naledi Pandor said in an interview in Cape Town on Tuesday. The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Talk of de-dollarization has emerged from governments keen to reduce their reliance on the US currency. The dollar has increased in value due to US interest rate hikes as well as geopolitical conflicts that have negatively impacted most emerging markets. According to Pandor, BRICS nations and other countries are questioning why they are committed to trading through the dollar and can t use their own currencies instead. South Africa has an internationally traded currency, Pandor pointed out, but cautioned that her country also holds significant debt in dollars, so you know we have to approach this discussion responsibly. The minister warned that de-dollarization would be complex and that there would be no guarantee of success. I don t think we should always assume the idea will work, because economics is very difficult and you have to have regard to all countries, especially in a situation of low growth when you are emerging from crises, Pandor told Bloomberg.

"12 May, 2023",South Africa responds to US claims of weapons deliveries to Russia,"Washington s accusations are disappointing and undermine bilateral ties, President Cyril Ramaphosa has said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has pushed back against accusations by a US envoy who claimed that Pretoria provided Russia with military assistance amid the Ukraine conflict. On Thursday, Reuben Brigety, the US ambassador to South Africa, told the media he is convinced that Pretoria supplied Moscow with arms and ammunition, which he said were loaded onto a cargo ship in Simon s Town, South Africa s main naval base, between December 6 and 8, 2022. The arming of the Russians is extremely serious, and we do not consider this issue to be resolved, and we would like South Africa to [start] practicing its non-alignment policy, the envoy stated. Brigety was apparently referring to the Russian-flagged ship called Lady R. The vessel was docked at the naval base during this period where it delivered and loaded unidentified cargo, triggering speculation and questions from South African politicians. The ship itself was sanctioned by the US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control last May over alleged weapon shipments. In a statement on Thursday, Ramaphosa hit back, saying Brigety s allegations undermine the spirit of cooperation and partnership between the two countries. The president went on to say that no evidence has been provided to support the claims that South Africa was sending arms to Russia, adding, however, that the government has ordered an independent inquiry into the matter. He noted that South African and US officials had discussed the issue, agreeing that the investigation will be allowed to run its course, and that the US intelligence services will provide whatever evidence in their possession. It is therefore disappointing that the US ambassador has adopted a counter-productive public posture that undermines the understanding reached on the matter. Unlike many other nations, South Africa, which has close historical ties with Moscow, has not imposed sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict. Ramaphosa said in May 2022 that the restrictions will only hurt bystander countries. In February, Pretoria held joint naval exercises with Russia and China off its coast, angering the US, which said at the time that the drills allowed Moscow to test its military capabilities and demonstrate that it still has international allies.

Tehran s trade with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa totalled nearly 48 million tons, with a value of more than $38 billion in the fiscal year 2022-2023, which represents a 14% increase in terms of value. The fiscal year in Iran begins on March 21 and ends on March 20 of the following year, coinciding with the Persian calendar year.

The trade increase comes despite the Maximum pressure sanctions campaign announced by the US in 2018 over Tehran s nuclear program.

"9 May, 2023",Turkiye offers to host mediation talks for Sudan,"President Erdogan says Ankara is ready to help with discussions if the military rivals agree to start comprehensive negotiations Turkiye is ready to host talks for Sudan if a decision is taken by the warring parties to begin comprehensive negotiations, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday. In a phone call with Sudan s Sovereign Council chairman, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Erdogan voiced his sadness and concerns over the rising number of casualties in the armed conflict that erupted in mid-April, a statement from the Turkiye s Communications Directorate said. He also addressed efforts to ensure the safety of Turkish citizens in Sudan and evacuate them from the country, the statement said. Ankara will also continue its efforts in contact with the United Nations to ensure that the urgent humanitarian needs of the Sudanese people are met. While ceasefire talks between the military rivals began on Saturday in Saudi Arabia s coastal city of Jeddah, backed by Washington, a Saudi diplomat told AFP on Monday that the discussions had yielded no major progress. Intense fighting, which broke out as a result of a power struggle between generals of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed at least 550 people, with around 5,000 injured since April 15, according to the Sudanese Health Ministry. The UN Refugee Agency is seeking $445 million to provide immediate support for an estimated 860,000 refugees and returnees from Sudan across Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic. Erdogan, who is seeking a third term as president in the May 14 election, has attempted to position Turkiye as a mediator in other conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. In December last year, the Turkish leader criticized the West for making provocations instead of acting as a mediator in the Ukraine conflict and highlighted Turkiye s efforts last year in brokering the Black Sea grain corridor deal.

"5 May, 2023",Scholz wants African Union in G20,"The German chancellor said respect for the continent demands that it has a say as a key partner German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed support for the African Union (AU) having a seat at the G20 as a sign of respect for the continent and its many states. Scholz, who arrived in Ethiopia on Thursday to begin a three-day trip to East Africa, stressed the significance of collaboration in addressing global issues and acknowledged the African Union as a central partner. The African Union is an important peacemaker and our central partner in Africa. We are united in the fight for security, against climate change and hunger, he tweeted on Thursday, emphasizing the need for the AU to be more involved in the G20 group of nations. Of the 55 states of the AU, South Africa is the only member of the G2O group of large economies. Last December, US President Joe Biden advocated for permanent AU membership, following a similar call by French President Emmanuel Macron as part of efforts to strengthen ties with the continent. The German chancellor told AU chairperson Moussa Faki in Ethiopia s capital, Addis Ababa, that integrating African nations into the G20 will ensure that they can participate and have a say. He added that Germany is also committed to advancing peace and security in Africa. That is why we have been addressing the various difficult security issues in different regions of Africa, he said, as reported by Africanews. Scholz also provided assurances of Berlin s support for a peaceful resolution of the Sudan conflict, which, according to the Health Ministry in Khartoum, has killed 550 people and wounded 4,926 as of Monday. The chancellor urged Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the regional government to continue working for a lasting peace and to deal with war crimes in the Tigray region, which experienced a two-year armed conflict that ended with a peace agreement signed last November. Scholz s second visit to Africa as chancellor aims to emphasize Germany s role as a reliable partner, as Chinese influence also grows in the region, Deutsche Welle reported. He is currently in Kenya, where he will reportedly discuss green energy, as well as the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

"4 May, 2023",The clash of civilizations is already underway as the world resists Westernization,"China s judgment is sound in attempting to rally non-Western nations against imposed values ByTimur Fomenko, a political analyst China s latest attempt to rally the world against Western values, reads a headline in The Economist, an outlet which is well known for its Anglo-capitalist outlook. The article begins by citing Samuel Huntington s clash of civilizations thesis, which argues that a clash between East and West would define the post-Cold War future as a form of cultural and religious identity conflict. In presenting this theme, the article then dives into what Xi Jinping has touted as his global civilization initiative based on the premise that civilizations can live in harmony. The catch, as interpreted by The Economist, is that the West must stop promoting its values, or Huntington will be proven right. Arguably, the world has been in a cultural conflict for a while now, and it didn t start with US-China competition. The rise and surge of political Islam, after all, pursuing hard-line interpretations of Sharia law, and even going as far as terrorism and insurgency, was a reaction to Westernization in the Middle East, an attempt to try and enforce an Islamic identity against it. To some extent, the War on Terror was a clash of civilizations as much as it was a clash of ideologies and cultural identities which saw each other as mutually existential threats. For the past 400 years or so, Western nations have dominated the world. European empires, as well as the United States, subjugated nations and built colonial states across the globe. This was done primarily for economic reasons, allowing these countries to enrich themselves at the expense of colonies and creating vast commercial empires which were enforced by military power. Such imperialists framed themselves as benevolent guardians who represented a higher form of civilization and values which they were bringing to the colonized. Thus, as they spread their empires throughout Africa, Latin America, the Indian subcontinent, Asia, and elsewhere. Westerners also sought to expand their ideology and value systems. It is because of this that Westernization and globalization have effectively meant the same thing, as the empires of old were the ones that brought the world together through the economic and trading system they created. But starting in the 20th century, many of the countries which were colonized by the West started to resist their oppressors, and movements for independence and liberation surged. One such movement, of course, was the rise of the Communist Party in China led by Mao Zedong, and every movement he inspired. While the US triumphed in the original Cold War and ushered in a new wave of globalization, styled as Pax-Americana, that era has now come to an end. This is because the world has changed, specifically through the emergence of China as a global power. The concept of globalization has shifted from being a West-dominated phenomenon, no longer synonymous with Westernization, to a more diverse one in which the US and collective West realize they no longer control. In other words, globalization is no longer a one-way road whereby the West imposes its values unilaterally on the rest of the world in conjunction with economic dominance. Countries such as China, as seen through programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative, are able to benefit from it too. This is where the new clash of civilizations comes in, precisely because China has gained the ability to challenge the West s vision for the world on a scale never seen before, and even surpassing that of the former Soviet Union. Contemporary China frames itself as a model within a multipolar order, seeking to reject the Western-centric version which has dominated the world for centuries and allowed these countries to exploit and change others. In doing so, China refuses Westernization and positions itself as its own civilizational pole. Of course, it is not alone, and Beijing finds support from many nations that have similarly been net losers and subject to colonialism, and who all seek a fairer international system. For example, this has great appeal to countries in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, South Asia and, of course, Russia. Many of these countries see the onslaught of Western values not only as historical threats to their national sovereignty, but also to their own cultural identity. Why, for example, is a country such as the United Arab Emirates, a traditional Western partner,now so pro-China? As a highly conservative Arab state, it views the pursuit of Western liberalism as a threat to its own Islamic values, and sees support in a Chinese state which, even espousing a different ideology, encourages plurality and respect for different civilizations as opposed to Western evangelism. Apart from very subservient countries such as Japan, the rest of the world has never wanted to be dominated by the West. That doesn t mean they are hostile to the West, but it does represent a longing to be treated as equal and to exist on their own terms as opposed to being at the bottom of an economic and value hierarchy which only benefits a small group of countries. As such, the new Cold War could very much be built on a clash of civilizations, because it is Western liberalism up against those who elect not to live by its premises.

"3 May, 2023",Tallest-ever hemp block building will be hotel media,"The 12-story edifice in South Africa would be the first skyscraper to incorporate cannabis-based materials South Africa is opening a hotel soon that will be the world s tallest building made out of industrial hemp. The 12-story structure in Cape Town, consisting of 54 rooms and named 84 Harrington Street, is expected to be completed next month. The building s walls are erected using hempcrete bricks made from the cannabis plant and supported by a concrete and cement structure. Afrimat Hemp, which produces the bricks, claims that they are eco-friendly, carbon negative, fire-resistant and also provide insulation. Boshoff Muller, director of Afrimat Hemp, told AFP that the plant absorbs the carbon, it gets put into a block and is then stored into a building for 50 years or longer. Though the business is a major processor of cannabis, the builders said they had to import industrial hemp from Britain for the project, as South Africa had prohibited local production until the government began issuing cultivation permits last year. In February of this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa pledged to prioritize the development of the country s fledgling cannabis industry, citing the potential for at least 130,000 jobs. Afrimat Hemp intends to produce its first blocks from South African hemp soon and Wolf+Wolf, the architect of the Hemp Hotel, has said that using locally grown cannabis will increase the number of such structures as 84 Harrington Street in the region. The firm behind the hemp blocks has addressed concerns over the cost of using hemp bricks but said that while they are 20% more expensive than traditional materials, their ability to lower carbon emissions presents huge opportunities in the fight against climate change. We can fund forests or we can fund someone to live in a hemp house. It s the same principle, Wihan Bekker, carbon consultant at Afrimat Hemp, explains in AFP s report.

"3 May, 2023",Key US ally reduces role of dollar in trade,"South Korea and Indonesia are planning to switch to national currencies The central banks of South Korea and Indonesia have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote bilateral trade in national currencies, moving away from the US dollar as an intermediary. The step is expected to help South Korean and Indonesian corporations to lower transaction costs and exposure to exchange rate risks, the central banks of the two nations said in a joint statement. The Bank of Indonesia and the Bank of Korea highlighted that they would continue to strengthen collaboration through information-sharing and regular discussions, as the two nations seek to boost financial ties. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the 26th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting that kicked off in the South Korean city of Incheon on May 2. The ASEAN+3 group consists of the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which are joined by China, Japan, and South Korea. Attempts to shift away from the greenback in international trade have been gaining momentum among major economic blocs such as ASEAN and the BRICS group, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The step comes against the backdrop of sweeping sanctions introduced by Western nations against Russia, a major global energy producer and exporter. The head of the Indonesian central bank, Perry Warjiyo, said last month that his nation was implementing a shift away from the dollar with countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Japan. In March, Brazil and China signed an agreement to trade in their own currencies, dropping the greenback as an intermediary. ",https://www.rt.com/business/575693-south-korea-indonesia-dollar-trade/
"2 May, 2023",Rivals in Sudanese conflict agree to peace talks media,"The negotiations may be held in Saudi Arabia and would prioritize a stable and reliable ceasefire, a UN official said Sudan s warring parties have agreed to engage in negotiations on a sustained ceasefire, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Monday, citing the UN special representative in the country, Volker Perthes. The talks, which may take place in Saudi Arabia or South Sudan, will initially focus on establishing a stable and reliable truce, according to Perthes, although he warned that getting both sides to respect a ceasefire would be difficult. He said logistical issues would need to be resolved, including the provision of safe passage through each other s territories. That is very difficult in a situation where there is a lack of trust, the envoy told AP. General Mohamed Daglo, commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), reportedly told Asharq, a Saudi-based TV station, that his organization had designated its representatives for the talks. However, he emphasized the need for trust-building measures before a settlement can be reached. Since the escalation of tensions between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF on April 15, the Sudanese Health Ministry has reported 528 deaths and 4,599 injuries in the fighting, which is now in its third week. The preliminary committee of the Sudan Doctors Union said on Tuesday that the total number of civilian deaths since the start of the clashes had risen to 447, with 2,255 civilians injured. There are many injuries and deaths that are not included in [these figures], and hospitals could not be accessed due to mobility difficulties and the security situation in the country, the committee said in a statement. Despite a series of temporary truces over the past week, fierce battles have reportedly continued in some areas, leading to the displacement of civilians and further exacerbating Sudan s humanitarian situation. The Sudan Doctors Trade Union has warned of a total collapse of the healthcare system in Khartoum, el-Geneina, and other cities across the country, noting that 69% of clash zone hospitals are no longer in operation. The special representative of the secretary-general for Sudan and head of the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan also warned of a major humanitarian crisis as Khartoum residents run out of food and clean water, a situation worsened by the destruction of water systems caused by fighting. If we don t get a stable ceasefire... the humanitarian situation will be even worse, Perthes said, as quoted by AP. The World Food Program (WFP) announced on Monday that it was lifting its temporary suspension of operations in Sudan, which was imposed after three of its employees were killed in the Darfur region at the start of the conflict.

"30 Apr, 2023",Leading non-western states resisting US pressure over Russia WaPo,"Countries are trying to sit out the standoff between Washington, Moscow and Beijing, leaked documents seen by the paper suggest India, Brazil, South Africa AND Pakistan —and numerous other emerging economies — have rebuffed American attempts to enlist them in the fight against Russia amid the conflict in Ukraine, the Washington Post has reported, citing leaked Pentagon files. According to classified US intelligence documents, which investigators believe were released online by US Air National Guard serviceman Jack Teixeira, India has no intention of taking sides in the standoff over Ukraine, the paper reported on Saturday. One of the documents seen by the Post suggests that during a meeting in February, Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Kumar Doval told the Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, that New Delhi was resisting pressure to support a Western-backed UN resolution on Ukraine. India would not deviate from the principled position it had taken in the past, Doval reportedly assured the Russian official. Another leaked file suggested that Brazil was more interested in playing a mediation role in the conflict than supporting Washington and its allies. Russia favours the idea of a world peace bloc to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, put forward by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during his visit to China earlier this month. Moscow believes it would counteract the West s aggressor-victim narrative about Kiev, according to the document. In late February, Brazil welcomed two warships from America s arch foe Iran, with one of the files suggesting that Lula likely allowed the port call to bolster his reputation as a global mediator and burnish Brazil s image as a neutral power. The leaks also revealed that when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited South Africa last year and raised the Ukraine issue, he was told by local officials that Pretoria would not be bullied into making decisions that go against its interests, the Washington Post wrote. An intelligence file from February 17 reportedly described discussions between Pakistan s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his subordinate about an upcoming UN vote on Ukraine. It said the aide pointed out to the premier that support for the Western-sponsored resolution would signal a shift in Islamabad s position, after its earlier abstention on a similar draft. Such a move would jeopardize important trade and energy deals with Russia, he warned, as cited by the Post. Pakistan was among 23 abstaining nations when the vote at the UN General assembly took place a week later. As for Central Asian countries, their leaders were eager to work with whoever offers the most immediate deliverables, which for now is China, another leaked document, seen by the newspaper, suggested.

The Turkish Defense Ministry said light weapons were fired at a C-130 evacuation plane which had been sent to the Wadi Sayidna airbase to evacuate nationals. The ministry added the aircraft had landed safely with no injuries to the crew, but that it required repairs. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group has denied accusations from the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) that it carried out the attack, dismissing the claims as unsupported by any factual evidence. Our forces have remained strictly committed to the humanitarian truce that we agreed upon since midnight, and it is not true that we targeted any aircraft in the sky of Wadi Sayidna in Omdurman, the RSF said in a statement. Foreign troops have secured the Wadi Sayidna airfield, which lies 20km to the north of Khartoum and has been utilized to evacuate citizens from countries such as Germany, the UK, the US, France, and others after violent clashes erupted in Sudan on April 15. The Turkish Embassy in the Sundanese capital announced on Thursday that about 1,500 civilians, including 1,383 Turks, had been removed, with efforts underway to evacuate additional people.

"28 Apr, 2023",Sports body sides with South Africa over removal of Israeli team,"World Rugby has said it is satisfied the club's participation in the Mzansi Challenge posed a legitimate security threat The global governing body for rugby has concluded that a decision made by the South African Rugby Union (SARU) to disinvite an Israeli team, Tel Aviv Heat, from an international competition last month was not discriminatory, but justified by security threats, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) reported on Thursday. World Rugby reportedly based its verdict on public reactions to the Israeli team s initial invitation, which included a Facebook post warning of a potential blood bath and a statement from the South African Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) coalition claiming that SARU would have blood on its hands if the Heat participated in the tournament. In February SARU withdrew the Tel Aviv Heat from the Rugby Mzansi Challenge, pointing to security concerns. The union s president said that the decision was made after listening to the opinions of important stakeholder groups and in order to avoid the likelihood of the competition becoming a source of division. The South African department of sports, arts, and culture also supported the move, citing the need to maintain a safe environment. The action was widely criticized, with Israel-based NGO International Legal Forum, according to Jewish News Syndicate, describing it as a cave-in to extremist anti-Israel forces promoting the racist BDS campaign. New Zealand-based lawyer Ian Dunwoodie filed a complaint with the World Rugby Council alleging that SARU breached the World Rugby constitution by axing the Israeli side from the game. Dunwoodie requested an investigation, citing the constitution, which prohibits discrimination of any kind against a country or against a private person or groups of people, according to the Algemeiner. However, as reported by the JTA, World Rugby stated in a letter dated March 29 that it is satisfied with the explanation provided by SA Rugby that the decision to withdraw the invitation to Tel Aviv Heat to participate in the Mzansi Challenge was based on concerns about an increased safety and security threat. The letter also acknowledged potential threats of violence, disruption and risks to the safety of stakeholders, together with concerns about the ability of SA Rugby to meet its obligations as an event organizer under the Safety at Sports and Recreational Events Act. The manager of the Israeli team, Pete Sickle, has challenged the ruling, claiming that they had anticipated a more thorough investigation by World Rugby into the circumstances surrounding the revocation of the invitation. We still have not seen tangible evidence of credible and significant threats to public safety. We haven t seen any evidence of SARU or South African security forces analyzing those threats before making this decision, Sickle told JTA ",https://www.rt.com/africa/575498-south-africa-rugby-israel-invite/
"27 Apr, 2023",UK troops hamper evacuation from Sudan media,"The unannounced presence of British military forces in Khartoum has led to the blockage of an airfield, German officials reportedly claim The UK was responsible for delays in the evacuation of other countries citizens from Sudan last weekend, sparking German discontent, the BBC reported on Thursday. The British Defence Ministry has dismissed the allegation as inaccurate. Senior German political sources told the UK state broadcaster that London s military operation to evacuate embassy staff from Khartoum on Saturday led to a temporary blockade of the Wadi Seidna airfield, which Berlin and other European nations had planned to use to evacuate their citizens. The outlet s sources alleged that the British forces landed without the permission of the Sudanese army, which angered them and resulted in the blocking of access to the site. According to them, this resulted in German rescuers losing at least half a day as negotiations to use the airstrip took place. However, a spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) told the BBC that it was complete nonsense to claim that British forces landed in Sudan without permission from the Sudanese army. We had permission, the source added. The MoD said it was also inaccurate to suggest that Britain's efforts to evacuate embassy staff from Sudan had slowed down Germany's plans. Operating in such complex circumstances will always come with challenges, but we have worked extremely closely with our French, US and particularly German partners who have facilitated access to the airfield throughout this week, and of course we remain grateful to the Sudanese Armed Forces, the ministry said, according to the BBC. On Wednesday, Germany announced the end of its rescue mission in Sudan, with 780 people from over 40 countries, including 230 German citizens, flown out of the country, where the armed conflict has killed 512 people and injured 4,193 others, according to the country's health ministry. Meanwhile, the UK has reportedly airlifted 536 people out of the over 2,000 stranded British nationals who have registered with the Foreign Office to be evacuated from the east African country. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC on Thursday that we wanted to ensure we didn't put British nationals into increased danger while defending the pace of London s evacuation response.

Al-Bashir and about 30 others were moved to the Aliyaa hospital on the recommendation of medical staff at Kober Prison before fighting between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) broke out on April 15, Al Jazeera reported, citing the army. Former Sudanese politician Ahmed Haroun, who is facing International Criminal Court charges for alleged war crimes in the Darfur conflict, which the UN said killed 300,000 people and displaced 2.5 million, announced on Tuesday that he was no longer locked up after being held for four years. According to local media, Haroun confirmed in a statement that he and other former top officials of the dissolved National Congress Party, including former Vice President Ali Osman, had left Kober Prison following a break-in. We remained in detention in Kober for nine days and we now have the responsibility for our protection, the former South Kordofan governor said, according to Africanews. He claimed that armed attacks, a lack of security, food, and other basic necessities, as well as deaths and injuries among inmates and penitentiary officials, triggered their decision to flee the prison without a judicial release order. Haroun added that they were ready to face the judiciary when the security situation improved. Kober was one of five jails raided between April 21 and 24, which the Sudanese Interior Ministry blamed on the RSF. Police in Khartoum told the media that the attacks resulted in the deaths and injuries of several prison officials, as well as the release of all detainees.

"26 Apr, 2023",Gold leading revolt against dollar economist,"Central banks are buying the commodity as a hedge against possible sanctions, a market expert has suggested Central banks around the world are shifting away from the US dollar and turning their attention to gold as a safe haven asset, the chairman of Rockefeller International, Ruchir Sharma, has said. Prices for the commodity have surged 20% in the past six months, with demand coming not from the usual suspects such as large and small investors seeking a hedge against inflation and low real interest rates, but from heavy buyers like central banks, Sharma wrote in the Financial Times on Sunday. According to the investment expert, regulators are sharply reducing their dollar holdings and seeking a safe alternative. Central banks now account for a record 33% of monthly global demand for gold and are ramping up gold-buying more than at any time since data began in 1950, Sharma added. This buying boom has helped push the price of gold to near-record levels and more than 50% higher than what models based on real interest rates would suggest, he explained, adding that clearly, something new is driving gold prices. Sharma pointed out that nine of the top ten central bank buyers are in the developing world, including Russia, India, and China. Not coincidentally, these three countries are in talks with Brazil and South Africa about creating a new currency to challenge the dollar, Sharma noted. He attributed the rush for the precious metal to increasing sanctions pressure exerted by the US and its allies, with as many as 30% of nations facing international penalties up from 10% in the early 1990s. Thus, the oldest and most traditional of assets, gold, is now a vehicle of central bank revolt against the dollar, Sharma argued. Some countries began to seek alternatives after seeing Russian assets frozen abroad and the country cut off from the SWIFT global financial messaging system. Suddenly, it was clear that any nation could be a target, Sharma wrote. According to the expert, the US saw sanctions as a cost-free way to fight Russia, but in reality the weaponization of the dollar has come at a cost for Washington as even allies such as Thailand and the Philippines have started to look for alternatives.

"26 Apr, 2023",South Africa remains ICC participant presidency,"President Cyril Ramaphosa misspoke when he claimed the country would withdraw from the court, his spokesman clarified South African President Cyril Ramaphosa made a mistake when he said the country would leave the International Criminal Court (ICC), his office said on Tuesday. This clarification follows an error in a comment made during a media briefing held by the governing African National Congress (ANC) on South Africa s status with regard to the ICC, Ramaphosa s office said in a statement on its website. Regrettably, the President erroneously affirmed a similar position during a media session today. The presidency affirmed that South Africa remains a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC s key document, and will continue to campaign for equal and consistent application of international law. Ramaphosa suggested pulling out of the court earlier as his country prepares to host a BRICS summit (an informal group that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) in August. Last month, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The court accused Putin and Russian Children s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova of the unlawful deportation of children from occupied areas of Ukraine. The charges refer to Russian efforts to evacuate civilians away from areas mostly in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Donbass that were shelled by the Ukrainian military. Russia, which like the US is not an ICC signatory, has taken in approximately 2.9 million refugees from Ukraine, more than any other country. Moscow has denied the allegations, maintaining that children were being lawfully evacuated from a combat zone and later reunited with their families when their relatives came forward. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said the ANC has taken the decision that it is prudent that South Africa should pull out of the ICC largely because of the manner in which the ICC has been seen to be dealing with these types of problems. As a party to the ICC, South Africa is supposed to respect the court s decisions. Russia signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but did not ratify it, and has since withdrawn its signature.

He also pointed out that less than 3% of Ukrainian grain went to countries that most needed it Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia while more than 80% went towealthy countries. Prisoner swaps require privacy Asked about the fate of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and ex-Marine Paul Whelan, Lavrov revealed that a special channel for discussing possible prisoner swaps was set up on the presidential level, but does not provide for the involvement of journalists. The Russian diplomat reminded Western reporters that their governments lamented the arrest of people caught spying, but no one seemed to care about the unjust imprisonment of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, or Russians abducted in the West and imprisoned on dubious charges. Sudan, Africa and non-interference Commenting on the current conflict in Sudan, Lavrov pointed out that the US initiated the separation of South Sudan in 2011, but instead of supporting both states, Washington imposed sanctions and kept imposing demands. This is a form of geopolitical engineering and doesn t bring about any positive results, he said, adding that outside powers should not interfere on the continent, but allow for African solutions to African problems. What NATO says Russia wants, versus reality Russia s top diplomat took issue with the claim that the conflict in Ukraine had caused to expand NATO to Finland and possibly Sweden. The US-led bloc had always wanted to grow, Lavrov said, despite repeated promises to Moscow that proved to be lies as was the case with the Minsk Agreements, regarding Ukraine. Russia has stated its objectives very clearly: removing any threats to its security from Ukraine and protecting people who face discrimination and extermination, he said. As for US goals, Lavrov described the recent media speculation about ceasefire talks after the Ukrainian offensive as the logic of a schizophrenic. WWIII and how to prevent it Lavrov brought up a statement by US President Joe Biden about how the West helping Ukraine was somehow preventing the Third World War, and reminded reporters that top British, French and German officials have engaged in nuclear saber rattling. Meanwhile, Russia has offered to sign a joint statement denouncing nuclear war. These Western statements about Ukraine leading to WWIII, I hope the people making these claims are of sound mind, he said. Russia s response to sanctions According to the Russian foreign minister, the US-led embargo against Russia has unleashed a process of de-dollarization around the world, as countries realized how Western dominance in the financial system could be weaponized. Moscow has no intention of relying on countries, or companies, that lie and try to cheat, but is looking to develop domestic industries previously dominated by foreign corporations. Fearing alternative views Lavrov once again brought up the fact that the US effectively blocked accredited Russian journalists from coming to New York to cover his visit. The West, he said, went from a 1980s rhetoric of human rights and freedom of information to repressing alternative viewpoints that disagreed with its preferred narratives first denying credentials to RT and Sputnik, then outright banning them. He also brought up the dismissal of Tucker Carlson from Fox News, saying this impoverished the diversity of thought in the US media space. As for Moscow s response, he would not specify what it might be, only that the US behavior will be remembered when Americans need something from us.

"25 Apr, 2023",South Africa vows to quit ICC following Putin warrant,"President Cyril Ramaphosa said the governing party s decision is based on the unfair treatment of certain countries by the tribunal The South African government has decided to again attempt a withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Tuesday. His statement comes as the forthcoming BRICS summit, to be hosted in Durban in August, has been handed a logistical problem by The Hague-based organization s targeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The decision, according to the president, was reached by the African National Congress (ANC) party after a weekend meeting. Yes, the governing party has taken that decision that it is prudent that South Africa should pull out of the ICC, Ramaphosa said following a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, who is on a diplomatic visit to Pretoria. Largely because of the manner in which the ICC has been seen to be dealing with (these) type of problems. Ramaphosa was referring to what he called the unfair treatment of certain countries by the tribunal. South Africa first attempted to withdraw from the ICC in 2016, but the move was revoked following a High Court ruling that found it was unconstitutional. That decision came after the country was found to have violated its obligations to the ICC by failing to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during his visit to the country in 2015 for an African leaders summit. The former Sudanese leader was facing genocide charges before the court relating to the long-running Dafur conflict. The latest withdrawal announcement follows the issuance of an arrest warrant for President Putin by the ICC in March. The court has accused the Russian leader of the unlawful deportation of children from occupied areas of Ukraine. The charges relate to what Russia says were efforts to evacuate civilians from the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Donbass, which was being heavily shelled by the Ukrainian military. South Africa, which is set to host leaders from the world s largest emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa at the BRICS summit in August, would be obliged to enforce the ICC s warrant for Putin s arrest as a signatory of the 2002 Rome Statute. Asked on Tuesday if Pretoria would arrest Putin, Ramaphosa said the matter was under consideration. His party secretary Fikile Mbalula said, however, that Putin was welcome in the country any time and that the ICC only serves the interests of a few. Earlier this month, Ramaphosa announced that he would send a delegation to Washington to clarify his non-aligned stance on Putin and the situation in Ukraine.

"25 Apr, 2023",Biohazard risk in Sudan as warring faction seizes lab WHO,"Technicians have been denied entry to a facility where samples of diseases are stored, according to an official The World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a potential biological hazard in Sudan on Tuesday, describing an armed faction s seizure of a laboratory holding samples of pathogens including polio and measles as an extremely dangerous situation. There is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab... by one of the fighting parties, Nima Saeed Abid, WHO representative in Sudan, told reporters in Geneva via video link. He said technicians have been thrown out with no accessibility to the lab, and no way to safely contain the biological material and substances available. Nima said at least 459 people have been killed and 4,072 injured in the fighting that broke out on April 15 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The country s capital, Khartoum, and nearby towns have been gripped by nearly two weeks of intense bombardment, causing severe food, water, medicine, and fuel shortages. Doctors Without Borders Operational Manager for Sudan, Abdalla Hussein, told RT on Friday that hospitals in Khartoum and surrounding cities have closed due to heavy shelling. According to the Sudanese Doctors Union, 13 hospitals have been bombed and 19 have been forced to evacuate, six ambulances have been attacked by military forces, and others have been denied passage to transport patients and receive aid since the conflict began. The International Organization for Migration and the World Food Programme suspended their operations in Sudan after some of their employees were killed in the fighting. In areas where intense fighting has hampered our humanitarian operations, we have been forced to reduce our footprint, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, said on Tuesday. Over the past few days, tens of thousands of civilians Sudanese and foreign nationals are said to have fled to Egypt, Chad, and South Sudan. Laura Lo Castro, the UN refugee agency s representative in Chad, stated that around 20,000 refugees have already arrived in the Central African nation, with up to 100,000 expected in the worst-case scenario. Following unsuccessful attempts to establish a truce last week, the rival factions have now agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire beginning on Tuesday. Despite the deal, Al Jazeera has reported that intense fighting persists near the presidential palace in the northern part of the capital, and new clashes have erupted in the West Darfur city of Geneina.

"25 Apr, 2023",Russia urges expansion of UN Security Council,"The West is over-represented in the United Nations main conflict-solving body, Moscow s top diplomat has said The representation of Asia, Africa and Latin America on the UN Security Council (UNSC) should be expanded so that the key international conflict-solving body can meet modern geopolitical needs, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. True multilateralism demands the adaptation of the UN to the objective tendencies of the forming multipolar architecture in international relations, Lavrov said in a speech at the UN headquarters in New York City on Monday. This means that the reform of the UNSC has to be accelerated through the expansion of the representation of Asian, African and Latin American countries in it, he explained. The current massive over-representation of the West in this crucial UN body undermines the principle of multipolarity, Lavrov pointed out during a discussion on effective multilateralism that was organized by Russia as current holder of the council s rotating presidency. Lavrov didn t specify if he was calling for specific nations from Asia, Africa and Latin America to become permanent members of the UNSC, or for quotas for the non-permanent representatives of those regions to be expanded. The UN Security Council currently consists of five permanent members, each with a power of veto China, France, Russia, the UK and the US — and ten non-permanent members, elected every two years by the UN General Assembly. According to current rules, five African and Asian states, one Eastern European state, two Latin American states and two Western European and other states make up the non-permanent members. With Switzerland and Malta being non-permanent members, the West currently has five seats on the council, more than any other region. Japan, which is a close ally of Washington, is also among the ten current non-permanent members. During the same discussion, US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield also urged a reform of the UNSC, saying that this body must evolve to meet the 21st century in order to better reflect today s global realities. She didn t specify what changes are needed, but commented that our response to Russia s flagrant violations [of the UN Charter] can t be to abandon this institution s founding principles. In his address, Lavrov again rebuked Western claims that Russia s military operation in Ukraine was illegal, saying that the UN Charter calls for respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states with governments that represent all of its people. It s clear to any unbiased observer, the minister said, that the Kiev authorities, which had come to power a result of a bloody coup in 2014 and which mistreated its Russian-speaking population, don t meet this criteria.

"25 Apr, 2023",Court overturns cancellation of Roger Waters concert,"A German court has overturned a decision to cancel a concert by English rock legend Roger Waters in Frankfurt. Regional officials had argued that allowing an anti-Semite to perform at a venue linked to the Holocaust would offend the local Jewish community. The ruling by Frankfurt s administrative court on Monday said Waters had the right to access the Festhalle Frankfurt concert hall for an appearance scheduled for May 28 as contracted, German media reported. It overturned a decision by the organizers of the Messe Frankfurt trade fair, who had refused to host the musician in late February. German officials had justified the decision by branding Waters as one of the world s most influential anti-Semites, claiming he should not appear at a venue associated with the persecution of Jews by the Nazis. In November 1938, Festhalle Frankfurt was used to detain more than 3,000 Jewish men, who were rounded up during the Kristallnacht pogroms in the city, before being sent to concentration camps. The 79-year-old rock icon is a well-known critic of Israel and a supporter of Palestinian rights. He has been using his musical platform to advocate for these causes, but denies allegations of anti-Semitism. His critics cite Waters support for the BDS movement, a campaign to boycott Israel modeled on the international movement against Apartheid South Africa, which the Israeli government claims denies the Jewish nation s right to exist. The Frankfurt court acknowledged that the This is Not a Drill! tour performances include some imagery borrowed from the Nazis, and that showing those symbols at the venue may be considered tasteless. But they do not glorify Nazism and cannot be legally banned, it added. The German authorities may appeal the ruling. Waters tour also includes concerts in Munich, Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne, where some legal challenges have also been mounted. ",https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/575290-frankfurt-roger-waters-concert/

"22 Apr, 2023",Kirill Strelnikov: Western experts thought they would destroy Russia s economy. They failed,"The hive mind, with access to political ears and mainstream media pages, claimed that Russia s economy was smaller than that of Italy, based on GDP. Reality paints a very different picture. ByKirill StrelnikovRIA Novosti As is often the case in the Western media, the most embarrassing facts are only covered when they can no longer be hidden, but even then unpleasant admissions are made with numerous caveats and excuses. This week, the International Monetary Fund published a report, which drew the long overdue conclusion that the economic hegemony of the leading Western countries, represented by the G7, is shrinking as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) surge. Its conclusions were, of course, polished by all the leading Western media outlets, but one thing became clear: Any triumphant Western predictions about the BRICS in general, and Russia in particular, can be safely tossed into the rubbish bin. In 2007, Western experts published a reassuring report stating that the total contribution of the BRICS to the world economy would not be comparable to that of the G7 until 2032. But once again Western economic projections have failed, and the fact is that the BRICS countries caught up with the G7 in terms of their contribution to world economic growth as early as 2020, and at the moment the figures, even creatively manipulated by pundits, stubbornly show that by 2028 the BRICS will account for at least 35% (some sources say as much as 40%) of world GDP (compared with 27.8% for the G7). Western analysts, who are in fact echoing the wishes of the global deep state, have fallen into a similar trap in their assessment of Russia s prospects and impact on the global economy. As we recall, since the beginning of last year, more sanctions have been imposed on Russia than on any other country in history, and the main talking heads in the West have reported with anticipation that the Russian economy will soon be reduced to dust. Such was their confidence (after all, a petrol station with matryoshka dolls couldn t possibly stand up to the combined economic might of the enlightened West) that analysts didn't even bother with figures. The prediction was simple: Russia would be quickly and irrevocably destroyed first its economy and then its social cohesion. A common trope for a number of years has been a comparison between the economies of Russia and Italy, with spurious claims that the economy of the world s largest country is no bigger than that of the home of pizza and pasta, all based on simplistic measurements which fail to take into account currency differences, and overvalue the debt-fueled services sector. But something went wrong, and to the astonishment of the prognosticators, not only did Russia not kneel, it did not even bend to their will. The country's position as a global energy superpower has been reaffirmed, and the title of global food superpower has been added. Other such titles will come in time. The forecasters began to compare their calculations and came to the conclusion that they had been counting wrongly. As a result, a respected US publication, The National Interest, has published an ashen article whose main conclusion is that the comparison of the economies of Russia and Italy betrays the blatant incompetence of Western experts. In short, the roots of the comparison lie in the methodology of comparing economies by nominal GDP the total value of all goods and services produced or sold in a country over a given period. Indeed, according to the World Bank, Russia's nominal GDP in 2013 was about $2.29 trillion and Italy's was about $2.14 trillion. But according to the authors of the article, the approach itself was fundamentally flawed: neither the exchange rate nor purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted for living standards and labour productivity, per capita wealth and, most importantly, the availability of crucial material resources and goods, as opposed to nice paper assets like the value of global brands, copyrights and so on, were taken into account in the calculations. With this correction alone, Russia's real GDP is quite comparable to that of Germany (one of the ten most economically developed countries in the world): $4.81 trillion for Russia versus $4.85 trillion for Germany in 2021. But even such sophisticated calculations do not reflect the real situation. In times of crisis, the production of physical goods comes first, and here the Russian economy is not only stronger than the German economy, but more than twice as strong as France. Add to this Russia's key role in supplying the world with energy, vital natural resources and food (not to mention its impact on global security) and we don t need the conclusions of the world s smartest analysts to understand our country s real place in the world. Not so long ago, the International Monetary Fund forecast 0.3% economic growth for Russia in 2023. Perhaps we should thank the experts and send this forecast to the same place as the others. Meanwhile, it s better that we win in the real world, not on paper. ",https://www.rt.com/russia/575180-western-experts-russias-economy/
"21 Apr, 2023",Why Western conservative parties are heading for populism or disintegration,"The Decline of Australia s Liberal Party is a case study on the internal divisions and loss of direction plaguing its counterparts elsewhere Graham Hryceis an Australian journalist and former media lawyer, whose work has been published in The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Sunday Mail, the Spectator and Quadrant. Graham Hryceis an Australian journalist and former media lawyer, whose work has been published in The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Sunday Mail, the Spectator and Quadrant. The Liberal Party of Australia a traditional conservative party akin to the Republican Party in the US and the Conservative Party in the UK is currently in a state of acute crisis, a situation not dissimilar to the instability experienced by most conservative political parties in the West over the past few decades. Formed in the late 1940s, the Liberal Party, in coalition with the smaller and ultra conservative National Party (representing the agricultural sector) has governed Australia for most of the post-World War II period. Last year, the coalition lost the federal election to the Labor Party (Australia s other major party) thereby ending an almost unbroken decade in power. In the recent New South Wales election, the Liberal-led government was defeated by Labor after a similar period in office. The Labor Party currently governs federally, in five of the six Australian states, and in both territories. How did the electoral demise of the Liberal Party come about? Why is a once dominant party seemingly incapable of winning an election anywhere in the country? Does the Liberal Party have a viable future? These questions, and the answers, raise significant issues relating to the future of conservative parties and liberal democracy in the West. The Liberal Party s decline has generated a great deal of angst-ridden discussion within the party, as well as the Murdoch media empire the party s long-standing loyal promoter and spin doctor. The general consensus is that the Liberal Party s decline is the result of its having strayed from its true conservative principles, by adopting politically correct ideologies that the party should have been openly and rigorously attacking. Some disenchanted Liberals go so far as to suggest that the party should re-embrace the conservative values of Robert Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party, and prime minister from 1949 to 1966. However, this is rank self-delusion. Menzies was committed to the White Australia policy, preserving the British Empire, and defending the policy of apartheid in South Africa. It is difficult to see what Menzies has to offer the modern Liberal Party, which is probably why he resigned in 1966 and was resolutely ignored by the party in his retirement. It is similarly misguided to suggest that a traditional conservative party hoping to attain office in its own right can openly attack the politically correct ideologies that currently prevail in Western liberal democracies. To do so would be to alienate significant segments of the electorate without whom success would be impossible. The suggested remedy of a simple turn to the right without more substance for the Liberal Party is a recipe for electoral oblivion. Any astute analysis of the current Liberal Party crisis must commence by acknowledging that the party has been racked by internal division for decades, and this is a major cause of its current predicament. Even a cursory glance at Liberal Party history over the past two decades makes clear that the party comprises two bitterly opposed factions. First, the conservatives professing religiously based traditional conservative values such as opposing same sex marriage and transgender rights, dubious about climate change and supportive of fossil fuels, Thatcherite in their economics and representing the interests of small business. Additionally, they are strongly pro-Britain and pro-US in foreign policy, while rabidly anti-China. Tony Abbott, the prime minister from 2013-15, was the former leader of this faction, and Peter Dutton, the current Liberal leader, is its wavering standard bearer at present. Second, the moderates socially progressive, embracing the #MeToo movement and transgender rights, for example. They are firmly committed to tackling climate change and advocates for renewable energy, Keynesian in their economics and representing the interests of global economic interests. They are also more pragmatic in respect to foreign policy and China. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister from 2015-18, was the former leader of this faction. Over the past 20 years, seemingly endless battles have taken place between these two factions for control of the Liberal Party. Each side has had victories all of which were pyrrhic and inconclusive. Turnbull deposed Abbott as sitting prime minister in 2015. Turnbull himself was then overthrown as prime minister in a coup led by Dutton in 2018, which installed Scott Morrison as a compromise prime minister. So fratricidal was the factional infighting within the Morrison government in its latter stages that it was incapable of passing key legislation, including Morrison s divisive Religious Freedom Bill, and moderate MPs regularly threatened to cross the floor and vote with the Labor opposition. Not surprisingly, the Morrison government was voted out of office in the May 2022 election. Liberal Party strategists play down the importance of the two factions while maintaining a we are a broad church rhetoric. Meanwhile, they refuse to acknowledge that the factions represent two distinct economic interest groups the older nation state-based elites and the new global elites that have emerged since the 1970s as the globalization of the world economy has gathered momentum. The economic interests and agendas of these two groups are diametrically opposed to each other. Ideological open warfare has broken out between them over the past 20 years as the new globalized economy has progressively displaced the older nation state based economic order. This ideological conflict has been termed the culture wars which conservatives persist in seeing as mere differences of opinion on matters of social policy that can be resolved by rational debate. In fact, the culture wars are a conflict between competing ideologies that legitimize two radically different economic world orders. They cannot be resolved by discussion because the new global elites are committed to imposing their worldview in a neo-totalitarian fashion, such as by canceling those who think differently. The fundamental dilemma confronting all conservative political parties in the West is that it is only conservative parties that have attempted to simultaneously represent the interests of these two irreconcilably opposed economic groupings. That is why only conservative parties continue to be plagued by fierce ideological internal division. It is a measure of conservative politicians complete lack of insight into the revolutionary global economic and ideological transformation that has engulfed and divided them. They foolishly persist in categorizing globalist politically correct ideologies as left-wing or, even more inaccurately, Marxist . That is utter nonsense. These ideologies legitimize the interests of extraordinarily powerful global economic elites, which is why they have been able to so easily infiltrate and dominate virtually all important institutions within Western liberal democracies, including the media, universities and schools, large corporations, bureaucracies, and the political process itself. No wonder conservatives have so comprehensively lost the culture wars they have been fighting Karl Marx when they should have been joining battle with the elite attendees at Davos. Traditional left-wing ideologies, of course, promoted socialism and/or the redistribution of wealth away from economic elites towards the working class. The West s current dominant ideologies legitimize the status and increasing wealth of the new global economic elites, who exhibit absolute contempt for those that have been impoverished by the process of globalization including the traditional working class. This lack of understanding by conservatives is compounded by their refusal to acknowledge that traditional left-wing progressive parties the Labor Party in Australia, Labour in the UK, and the Democrats in the US have, over the past 50 years, transformed themselves into parties that now, almost exclusively, represent the interests of the new global elites. No ideological divisions now exist within these formerly progressive parties simply ideological mopping-up exercises in which old-style socialists like Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders are finally drummed out of the party for good. This ideological unity, together with increased support from the now-dominant globalized economic interests, explains the current electoral success of the Labor Party in Australia, the Democrats in the US, and the upcoming electoral victory of Keir Starmer s Labour Party in the UK. This has escaped the notice of Liberal politicians in Australia who have been preoccupied with their own internal battles for decades. Unbelievably, there are many Liberals who genuinely believe that Labor Prime Minister Albanese is a socialist. The Liberal Party s recent political failures have come about because the party has lost two distinct categories of seats. First, seats in wealthy inner-city suburbs populated by the new global elites and their hangers-on. Second, seats in outer, formerly working-class suburbs, whose residents have been hardest hit by stagnant wages, increasing energy prices, and rising inflation the fruits of globalization. As to the first category, Liberal moderates have been defeated in these seats by a new political force the so-called Teal independents . The term Teal derives from the light blue coloring of their election propaganda. The Teals are wealthy members of the global elites for the most part young women lavishly funded by venture capitalists and renewable energy magnates. Promoting radical climate change policies, women s rights, and anti-corruption measures, the Teals have won a raft of formerly safe Liberal seats by cleverly demonizing the Liberal conservative faction and arguing that the moderates in the party are incapable of delivering on their promises. As to the second category, these seats have turned against the Liberal Party because of its longstanding opposition to wage and salary increases for ordinary workers which has led voters in groups to believe that the Liberal Party will do nothing for them. If these electoral trends persist and there is no reason to doubt that they will the Liberal Party, in its current manifestation, has no realistic prospect of regaining these seats. Last week, a further bout of destructive infighting broke out within the party over The Voice a controversial Labor Party proposal, born of identity politics, to create a constitutionally enshrined Aboriginal political body that will advise the federal parliament and government. A referendum is to be held later this year in which voters will decide whether to radically amend the constitution so as to create this powerful new arm of government. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has made The Voice his pet project and has skillfully transformed it into a classic culture wars issue. Rational debate has been shut down and anyone opposing The Voice runs the risk of being canceled. Peter Dutton recently announced that the Liberal Party would oppose the creation of The Voice, and this decision bound all shadow cabinet members, although other Liberal MPs were free to vote according to their conscience. This week, shadow Attorney General Julian Lesser, a prominent leader of the moderate faction, resigned from the shadow cabinet and announced that he intended to campaign in favor of The Voice. Greg Sheridan, writing in The Australian, described Lesser s action as“a savage blow against the Liberal Party”which, given the party s current state of crisis, is something of an understatement. Lesser s act of betrayal will further weaken the party and it confirms that the divisions within the Liberal Party have only intensified since last year s election defeat. How did the Liberal Party leadership respond to Lesser s treachery? In an extraordinary statement, Sussan Ley, the deputy leader of the party, said that she“admired Lesser s moral principles” and predicted that he would be a minister in a future Liberal government. If any further evidence of the party s feebleness and complete lack of resolve to deal with the crisis were needed, Ley s pathetic statement provides it. Lesser s defection confirms that the Liberal Party in its current form has no viable future. The party can carry on as it is hopelessly divided and lurching from crisis to crisis in which case it will become progressively more irrelevant and eventually disappear. Alternatively, in partnership with the ultra-conservative National Party, it can transform itself into a populist party, in which case it may have a future. Such a populist transformation would, however, have to entail the expulsion of the entire moderate faction. It would also necessitate a radical reorganization of the party s policy settings, away from protecting the interests of small business and towards representing those voters in the outer suburbs who have been left behind by the process of globalization. These people have no prospect of owning a home in the capital cities, can no longer afford big city rents, and are struggling to pay their energy and food bills. Whether the Liberal Party has the courage and ability to effect such a fundamental transformation is an open question. It certainly will not come about under the party s current leaders, and it may be that the National Party will have to provide the necessary leadership. As with so much else, it is Donald Trump who has been the harbinger of the future for conservative political parties in the West. Trump personally transformed the Republican Party into a populist party, in which moderate Republicans were stripped of power and influence thereby saving it from political oblivion, and bringing it extraordinary success. Some traditional conservative parties in other countries that have not moved in a populist direction have simply disappeared such as in France and Italy only to be replaced by powerful populist parties that either have, or are on the verge of, attaining power. Boris Johnson attempted to refashion the UK Conservatives along populist lines implementing Brexit and promising to look after those impoverished by globalization with his leveling up program but Johnson s salvage operation ended in failure. As a result, the deeply divided Conservative Party in Britain is headed for a crushing defeat in the next general election. So-called progressive political leaders in the West delight in the demise of traditional conservative parties. They ignore the grave dangers that the political instability inevitably produced by the rise of populist parties pose to the future of liberal democracy even though Trump s destructive antics since losing the 2020 election have put the writing on the wall. These leaders are completely oblivious to the consequences of the destruction of the social democratic consensus that has operated effectively in most Western countries for more than a century. This consensus integrated the working class into these societies and gave them a measure of prosperity, all within a liberal democratic political framework based on a two-party political system, one conservative and one protecting working class interests. It was this arrangement that provided most Western societies with an extraordinary degree of political and social stability for the entire 20th century. Thatcher and Reagan began the dismantling of this consensus in the 1980s, and it gathered momentum under so-called progressives like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. Their successors, Keir Starmer and Joe Biden, now openly do the bidding of the new global elites that are resolutely determined (much more so than Thatcher or Reagan ever were) to carry through the destruction of this consensus to finality irrespective of the political consequences. The demise of traditional conservative parties in the West is just one symptom of this process of ongoing destruction that has intensified over the past decade. More likely than not, the Liberal Party in Australia will disappear and be replaced by a populist party of some kind as is happening in other Western countries. But this is not something to welcome or celebrate as the globalized elites and the so-called progressive political leaders that now act exclusively on their behalf seem to believe. Rather, because it is a dramatic warning sign of the impending collapse of liberal democracy in the West, it is something to regret.",https://www.rt.com/news/575057-decline-australia-liberal-party/
"21 Apr, 2023",BRICS de-dollarization push gaining momentum Jakarta,"The economic bloc of developing nations has been working on establishing a new reserve currency Indonesia is following the lead of the BRICS group in its policy of shifting away from the US dollar in trade and financial transactions, according to the country s central bank. Jakarta has introduced transactions in the local currency to settle cross-border trades, the portal SINDOnews has reported, citing Bank of Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo. Indonesia has initiated diversification of the use of currency in the form of LCT [local currency trading]. The direction is the same as the BRICS. In fact, Indonesia is more concrete, Warjiyo said on Friday, addressing a press conference with the board of governors meeting. Indonesia has already implemented the practice with a number of countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Japan, he added. It also plans to sign a cooperation agreement with South Korea regarding local currency trading in early May. Warjiyo s statement comes as the BRICS economic bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa claims to be working on establishing a joint payment network to cut reliance on the Western financial system, and on the dollar in particular. The member countries have been increasing the use of local currencies in mutual trade and also working on establishing a new reserve currency. Last month, Brazil and China signed an agreement to trade in their own currencies, thus abandoning the greenback as an intermediary. China s attempts to ditch the dollar in international trade have intensified against the backdrop of the sweeping sanctions introduced by Western nations against Russia, a major global energy producer and exporter. Indian policymakers have also taken several steps towards shifting away from the greenback to rubles and rupees in mutual trade with Moscow. Russia began de-dollarizing its economy in 2014, when the West introduced the first round of sanctions against the country over Crimea. Moscow has been boosting the use of alternative currencies in transactions since last year, with President Vladimir Putin suggesting earlier that the Chinese yuan should be used more widely, not only in trade with China, but also in Russia s transactions with countries in Africa and Latin America. The latest data from the Bank of Russia shows that the yuan has become a major player in Russia s foreign trade. ",https://www.rt.com/business/575111-brics-dollar-trade-indonesia/
"20 Apr, 2023",African court claims jurisdiction in Meta unlawful dismissal cases,"Judge Matthews Nduma has found that Facebook's parent company can be sued in Kenya Kenya s employment and labor relations court ruled on Thursday that it has jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit filed by a group of content moderators against Meta, Facebook s parent company, alleging unlawful dismissal. Judge Matthews Nduma, in a ruling cited by Reuters, held that the labor court has jurisdiction to determine the matter of alleged unlawful and unfair termination of employment on grounds of redundancy. Meta, the owner Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, filed an appeal in February against a ruling that said the company could be sued in the East African country despite having no official presence there. The US company disputed the decision that Kenyan courts had jurisdiction over Meta after a former content moderator filed a complaint alleging poor working conditions.Last month, 43 moderators at Facebook s Nairobi moderation hub filed a case against the social media company and its local subcontractor Sama. The complainants alleged that they lost their jobs with Sama after attempting to form a union. They also accused meta of blacklisting them from applying for the same roles at another outsourcing firm, Luxembourg-based Majorel, after Facebook switched contractors. On March 21, Nduma temporarily blocked the mass redundancy of the content moderators, preventing Meta and Sama from terminating their contracts at the end of March until the legality of their dismissal was determined. Meta was also temporarily barred from subcontracting the roles of workers who moderate Facebook content for Eastern and Southern Africa, according to Reuters.Aside from the suit filed by the moderators, whose number has now grown to 184, and an earlier one submitted by a former South African employee, Meta is also facing a legal battle in Kenya from a local NGO and two Ethiopian citizens. The petitioners claimed that the company failed to act against online hate speech in Africa, calling for the establishment of a $1.6 billion compensation fund for victims.

"20 Apr, 2023",Germany blames Russia for Western setbacks in Africa,"Defense chief expresses alarm at Moscow s growing traction on the continent, especially in the Sahel region Berlin has reiterated concerns about Russia s growing influence in Africa, with the German defense minister claiming on Wednesday that the West is facing a geopolitical reversal in the region, particularly in the Sahel. Russian narratives and offers seem to be gaining traction here, and the Western community is losing ground here. And the Sahel is and will remain strategically relevant for precisely this reason, especially given the Russian presence in the region, Boris Pistorius said.He made the remarks in parliament during a debate about deploying German troops to Niger as part of a European Union military mission aimed at mitigating the risk of violence spillover from neighboring Mali.French President Emmanuel Macron has previously accused Moscow of pursuing a predatory project in Africa, particularly in Burkina Faso and Mali, where Paris has suffered military failures. Such a stance by Western nations shows a neo-colonial approach, according to remarks by Alexey Saltykov, the Russian ambassador to Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso.At the same time, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has urged Western powers not to involve Africa in their political issues while emphasizing that Russia, like any other country, has the freedom to be present anywhere on the continent. Those who come to Africa you hear people complain about China, then about Russia, but how about them? What right do they have to be in Africa that others don t have? Kagame said on Saturday during his visit to Benin. He said African countries needed to just get together to identify what we need in terms of partnership and who offers what we need, and leave to them their own, other problems. African leaders are increasingly supportive of Russia's presence on the continent, with South Africa, Djibouti, and Mali recently strengthening military ties with Moscow.Russian President Vladimir Putin has also expressed Moscow s commitment to continue building a full strategic partnership with Africa. He has also made known plans to continue supplying grain to needy African countries in the event Moscow exits a landmark agreement with Ukraine to allow exports from the country s Black Sea ports. I want to emphasize that our country has always given and will continue to give priority to co-operation with African states, Putin said in a televised address at a conference on Russian-African relations in March.

"20 Apr, 2023",US pressuring African state to mend ties with Israel Axios,"Washington has maintained a military presence in Niger for the better part of a decade US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Niger s president to normalize relations with Israel during his trip to Africa in March, according to Axios. The two countries officially severed ties in 2002 over Israeli military action in the Palestinian territories. In talks with Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum last month, Blinken pressed him to move toward normalizing relations with Israel, Axiosreportedon Wednesday, citing two US and Israeli officials. Blinken later briefed Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen on the discussions, the officials said, noting that Cohen proposed inviting Niger to the next Negev Forum, a yearly event involving the US, Israel, and Arab states such as Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. Multiple unnamed Israeli officials also said Niger s leadership is open to warming ties with Israel, but claimed they hoped for deliverables in return from Washington. Though Blinken is the first US secretary of state to visit the country since it gained its independence from France in 1960, Niger is nevertheless a major US security partner in the Sahel a region stretching across Africa south of the Sahara Desert. After investing $110 million to construct a massive drone base in the country in 2016, Washington has continued to pour large sums of security and humanitarian aid into Niger, making it the largest recipient of State Department military assistance in West Africa, according to a departmentfact sheet. US troops have operated in Niger intermittently throughout the War on Terror, and were deployed there under a broad status of forces deal in 2013. During his visit, Blinken announced a $150 million aid package for Sahel nations, including Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso, bringing total US assistance to the region to $233 million in 2023. Relations between Israel and Niger have long been rocky. After cutting ties in 1973, ties warmed in the wake of the 1996 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. However contacts were again cut after renewed Israeli fighting with the Palestinians in 2002. They have kept no formal diplomatic ties since. Israel has normalized relations with several Arab or Muslim-majority states in recent years under the US-brokered Abraham Accords, including Bahrain, the UAE, Sudan, and Morocco. However, some countries in the region, such as Oman, have said they are not ready to resume ties until Israel achieves peace with the Palestinians under a two-state solution, which appears unlikely in the near term asviolencecontinues to grip the occupied territories.

"19 Apr, 2023",Surge in Russian exports to Brazil revealed,"The South American nation has more than doubled imports from Russia since 2021 Imports of Russian goods to Brazil surged by nearly 120% in March compared to the same month two years ago, according to official figures released by Brazil s Economy Ministry. The country imported just over $746 million worth of goods from Russia last month, compared to $343 million in March 2021, the statistics show, with fertilizers being the main product imported. Brazil also started to buy diesel fuel from Russia, with imports expected to soar. According to a recent report by Reuters, Russia s share of Brazil s diesel fuel imports will reach 53% in April, compared to just 0.2% a year ago. Brazil has traditionally bought the fuel from the US; however, Russian diesel now comes with a hefty discount that is difficult to compete with, Reuters wrote. Despite the sanctions on Moscow, Brazil has no import restrictions on Russian diesel. Russian energy products were banned in Europe and the US last year, and Moscow has sought out new buyers. The flow of Russian goods to Brazil was at its highest last May, worth just over $1 billion. Exports from Brazil to Russia have seen an increase by 50% over the past two years, from $119 million in March 2021 to $179 million last month. Brazil mainly exports soybeans, meat, and coffee to Russia. Both nations are members of the BRICS group of emerging economies, which also includes India, China, and South Africa. Earlier this week, Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira criticized the economic sanctions that the US, EU, and allies imposed on Russia, saying they are having negative consequences for economies worldwide, especially in developing countries.

"19 Apr, 2023",BRICS to surpass G7 in share of global economic growth Bloomberg,"The bloc of developing countries will be a larger driver of development than the Western Group of Seven major economies Members of the BRICS group Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are expected to outpace the US-led G7 in terms of their contribution to the world s economic growth, from this year, Bloomberg reported on Monday. According to the outlet s calculations based on the latest IMF data the BRICS countries will contribute 32.1% of the world s growth, compared to the G7 s 29.9%. The Group of Seven nations (G7) consisting of the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan has long been considered the most advanced economic bloc of countries on the planet. Russia was a member, until 2014, when it was expelled due to the fallout from the Western-backed Maidan coup in Ukraine. The report indicated that in 2020, the contributions from BRICS countries and the G7 to global economic growth were equal. Since then the performance of the Western-led bloc has been declining. By 2028, the G7 s contribution to the world economy is predicted to decrease to 27.8%, while the BRICS will account for 35%. Bloomberg calculations show that China will be the top contributor to global growth over the next five years, with its share set to be double that of the US. China s share of global GDP expansion is expected to represent 22.6% of total world growth by 2028, the outlet wrote. India is projected to contribute 12.9% of global GDP. In total, 75% of global growth is expected to be concentrated in 20 countries and over half in the top four: China, India, the US and Indonesia. While Group of Seven countries will comprise a smaller share, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and France are seen among the top 10 contributors, the outlet wrote. A recent study by a UK-based macroeconomics research firm has also found that the gap between the two groups in terms of global economic weight is expected to continue to grow. The analysts noted that China and India have been experiencing robust economic growth, and more countries are interested in joining BRICS. Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that more than a dozen nations have expressed interest in joining BRICS, including Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bangladesh have acquired equity in the New Development Bank, the funding organization of BRICS.

"18 Apr, 2023",How South Africa is building partnerships with BRICS energy investors,"We can bring mutually beneficial solutions to the table, including financing, trade, investment, research, development and more ByProfessorAnil Sooklal, Ambassador-at-Large for Asia and BRICS and South Africa's BRICS Sherpa South Africa took over as Chair of BRICS on January 1, 2023 in a difficult national and global economic environment. The conflict in Ukraine and the West's unilateral sanctions, have battered economies that were struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With Russia being the world s third-largest oil producer, second-largest natural gas producer, and a top producer of steel and wheat, the conflict has led to substantial increases in food and energy prices that have disproportionately impacted those of us in the Global South. As a government, we have the South African Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan with detailed interventions to address our energy crisis with the aim of fixing Eskom (South African Energy Supply Commission), fundamentally transforming the electricity sector to achieve long-term energy security, and enabling and accelerating investment in the energy sector. It is clear that we cannot do this alone. President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on our BRICS partners to assist South Africa in our recovery. Our first priority responds to the significant transformational changes we are making in our economy, particularly in the energy sector. Therefore, we aim to ""Develop a partnership towards an equitableJust Transition.""This priority focuses on finding solutions to transformational energy change which will also improve people's livelihoods in the sectors that supported the old economy, such as mining. BRICS countries are uniquely positioned to support South Africa's energy recovery. Member countries contain almost half the world's population and account for approximately 40% of the world s energy consumption, including 48% of coal, 22% of oil, and 13.5% of natural gas. While renewable energy consumption is only 16% of the BRICS total at the moment, it has been growing year by year driven by members commitment to mitigating climate change. BRICS countries are not only consumers of energy, as all members have substantial fossil fuels and available renewable energy resources. Members hold 40% of the world's coal reserves, 25% of the world's natural gas reserves and 8% of the world's oil reserves. In the renewable energy sector, solar power from South Africa, Brazil and India, wind power from Russia and China, as well as biomass from Brazil, all enjoy substantial resource advantages. Within BRICS, China is the world's largest coal producer with 50% of the world's output in 2020 with India at 10%. Russia produced 12% of the world's oil and 16% of the world's natural gas. Brazil is rich in biomass energy and its output was 25% of the world's total in this sphere in 2020. With our natural resources, BRICS countries are major players in the global supply of energy and its dynamics. Member countries have developed similar energy policies to manage energy risks while having both expertise and technologies to use their energy resources to enhance energy security and cooperation. BRICS recognised these complementarities and in 2020, it adopted a Road Map for Energy Cooperation up to 2025 aimed at building a strategic partnership. The Road Map is being implemented in phases. The research phase is first and started under South Africa's chair of BRICS in 2018 with the establishment of the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform. The platform brings together experts, companies and research institutes to coordinate common interests of members in research and development of innovative technology and policies, with seven studies being released to date at the BRICS Ministers of Energy meetings. Last year, China presented an additional study on the development of renewable energy and smart grids in the member countries. This year, Russia is leading a study on energy security. The roadmap also established the publication of the annual BRICS Energy Report. During the second phase, BRICS countries will identify the needs and challenges to energy security and find areas where member cooperation can provide solutions. The third phase aims at advancing mutually beneficial cooperation including the exchange of best practices, use of advanced technology, as well as opportunities for trade and investment in each other's economies. Of course, we are not waiting for this third phase before we work with our partners on energy solutions. India is already South Africa s biggest coal export market and generates almost half of our total coal revenue. China is reopening opportunities for imports from South Africa, following its political fallout with Australia, previously an important coal source. China has substantial oil and gas trade with Russia, oil and gas cooperation with Brazil, a joint natural gas pipeline project with India as well as renewable energy trade with South Africa. South Africa is a pioneer in the area of clean coal, in which India and China have an interest. The Russian state energy company Rosatom has signed an agreement with South Africa to construct small hydropower plants in Mpumalanga as a key component of South Africa s energy security strategy. Part of South Africa's response to the energy crisis involves implementing a just transition to a low carbon economy. Climate change also poses considerable risks to jobs, businesses and the economy. South Africa is among the most water-scarce countries in the world, andrecent eventsin KwaZulu Natal have shown that extreme weather events such as floods are occurring more often and with a devastating impact on our infrastructure. The response to the electricity crisis provides an opportunity to also mitigate our contribution to, and the risks from, climate change and adapt to a low carbon economy. South Africa's Just Transition Plan aims to significantly lower emissions of greenhouse gasses and harnesses investments in new energy technologies, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient appliances. As a consequence, South Africa's Integrated Resource Plan, which drives our energy policy, envisions that renewable solar and wind energy will generate almost 25% of our electricity by 2030. Coal, which currently accounts for 85% of South Africa s electricity generation, will drop below 60% in less than a decade. The impact on communities reliant on coal extraction and production is an important element of the Just Transition as it aims to ensure that communities tied to high-emitting energy industries are not left behind and are provided with new skills and new economic and employment opportunities. During South Africa's Chairship of BRICS in 2013, we established the BRICS Business Council to strengthen and promote economic, trade, business and investment ties among the business communities of the member countries. The BRICS Business Council also identifies problems and bottlenecks and recommends solutions. This year, under South Africa's Chairship, the Council's Energy and Green Economy Working Group is focused on concrete outputs on the Just Transition. The Council has developed an energy skills roadmap for South Africa which will be rolled out to the other members. The roadmap identifies the necessary and available skills and identifies training programmes as well as sponsors across the member countries. There are discussions on the possible establishment of a BRICS African Centre of Excellence on the Just Energy Transition which would support a network of researchers focused on technology, socio-economic, environmental, financial and other aspects of the Just Transition that would inform policy makers in collaboration with the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform. The question is how to identify funding for investment in renewable energy. There is significant money available globally for renewable energy projects, with the National Treasury estimating $12 trillion in available sources such as the Green Climate Fund. But developing countries struggle to access these funds because of the perceived risk of investing in a developing country. South Africa's policy uncertainty and regulatory challenges have been cited as obstacles to South African investment opportunities, with other funders also banning financing and investment in coal for energy, even if it is clean coal. India and China are able to source their own international finance for renewable energy by offering their own-currency Green Bonds known as Green Masala Bonds and Green Panda Bonds. The Green Panda Bond is issued by the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB). The NDB is a multilateral development bank established by BRICS countries to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects. Sustainability is fundamental to the founding principles of the NDB, and aims to deliver transformative impact to member countries with a target of 40% of all the NDB s loans funding projects in mitigation of and adaptation to the effects of climate change by 2026. South Africa and China have so far been the leading beneficiaries of sustainable financing from the NDB with respect to clean and renewable energy. South Africa is the beneficiary of 12 projects financed by the bank valued at $5.4 billion. Five of these projects support the energy sector, with three of those funding renewable energy projects worth 13 billion rand ($710 million). The opportunities for BRICS to support transformative change in our economy are obvious. As Chair of BRICS this year, our strategic vision is to harness our existing mutually beneficial cooperation to address issues of national interest and national concern for South Africa in a holistic and multi-disciplinary way. The depth and strength of our partnership allows us to bring multiple solutions to the table, including financing, trade, investment, industrialization, training and development, research, innovation, as well as partnership with African countries and leading countries of the Global South.

"18 Apr, 2023",Lula s China trip proves Latin America is no longer the backyard of the US,"The Brazilian president has asserted his country s role as a player in its own right in the new multipolar world ByOliver Vargas, a Latin America-based journalist, co-founder of Kawsachun News and host of the 'Latin America Review' podcast Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has just returned from his highly anticipated and successful trip to China, generating optimism and enthusiasm for an enhanced role for Latin America as it emerges from the shadow of the US. Chinese President Xi Jinping s welcoming ceremony was the first sign the trip would be a success for everyone involved. As he and Lula walked down the red carpet, China s military band played a rendition of Novo Tempo , an 80s Brazilian song associated with the protests against the US-backed dictatorships of that time. Behind closed doors, 15 bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding were signed, including investment deals, research and development plans, food standards, state news agencies, technology transfers, and cooperation on building the seventh China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS). The meeting built upon years of strategic partnership. China displaced the US as Brazil s largest trade partner in 2009, and the event was about deepening that process. However, the most interesting facet of the visit was the tone of the public statements by both leaders, as it went beyond diplomatic niceties and showed a clear commitment from both countries in taking on a leadership role that will challenge the years of Washington s unipolar dominance. I wonder every night why all countries are forced to do their trade backed by the dollar. Why can t we do trade backed by our currency? said Lula at an event in Shanghai. The conflict in Ukraine was also on the agenda, and Lula made it clear that the US funneling billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Kiev regime was escalating, rather than calming, the conflict. He commented, It is necessary that the United States stop incentivizing the war and begin to speak about peace. The European Union needs to start talking about peace. This visit marks the beginning of a much closer relationship between Latin America and those challenging US dominance on the international stage. Once Lula returns, the next big item on the agenda will be a visit from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who will be embarking on a Latin America tour in which he ll also visit Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Lavrov s visits will be an opportunity to discuss areas of common interest for Russia and Latin America, such as trade, investment, energy, and defense. He will also attempt to strengthen cultural ties at a time when Washington is promoting xenophobia against Russians and Russian culture globally. The success of Lula s China trip will clearly put an extra spring in the step of the Latin American governments that will be receiving Russia s official delegation this week. The win-win cooperation possible with China and Russia stands in clear contrast to the arrogant finger-wagging and interventionism on offer from the US. However, Latin America is not a passive participant in the process of building a multipolar world. The region is taking on leading roles in the process. Former Brazilian president and Lula ally, Dilma Rousseff who is also the victim of a US-backed coup is starting her new role as chief of the BRICS development bank in Shanghai, a crucial coordinating role for Brazil, China, Russia, India, and South Africa, as well as for a possible BRICS plus expansion to include more emerging economies in the Global South. Washington has tried to court Lula ever since he was elected president. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America, so it would be unwise not to do so. The State Department has issued official condemnations of the right-wing rioters that attacked the Brazilian congress with the aim of preventing Lula from assuming office, its statements in support of Brazilian democracy was perhaps an attempt to communicate that the US would not work to undermine Lula s presidency, as they had done against other leftist presidents from Bolivia to Venezuela. For that reason, Washington has not formally responded to Lula s China trip and upcoming official meeting with Lavrov. Nevertheless, the cottage industry of pro-US analysts and commentators have been weighing in and setting a narrative that Lula was scoring an own goal by reaching out to China and Russia. The Argentina-based website Infobae, one of the largest right-wing digital media outlets in the region,ran a pieceentitled Lula's trip to China risks becoming a goal against Brazil . The author questions China s intentions by saying, Brazil, one of the richest countries in the world in terms of raw materials and natural resources, has everything to be a power on its own, without the help of any other foreign power. But to do so, it must overcome the corruption of its politicians and submit its management to strict scrutiny. The same outlets that decry the nationalization of industry and celebrate free trade deals with the US have suddenly taken a hardline third-worldist and isolationist turn. Others are warning Brazil of drawing the ire of Washington. Oliver Stuenkel, who writes for Americas Quarterly an outletfundedby Western oil corporations recentlysaid, The more Lula talks about Ukraine during this visit in China, which in Western perception is not a neutral actor, the greater the risk that Brazil will be seen in Europe and the United States as an actor closer to Russia than to them. Perhaps being an actor closer to Russia and closer to China will prove to be a more fruitful path for Latin America. Being an actor closer to Washington has resulted in unequal trade deals, coups, invasions, and much more. Lula s China trip shows that another, more equal relationship is possible. Lavrov s Latin America tour will be a fantastic opportunity for Latin America to build on this and elevate itself onto the global stage. ",https://www.rt.com/news/574882-lula-china-trip-us/
"18 Apr, 2023",Developer explains high demand for Indian-Russian missile,"The CEO of BrahMos has cited strong interest in the supersonic cruise missile from Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa The BrahMos supersonic cruise missile jointly developed by India and Russia is attracting a wide range of customers, although only countries friendly to New Delhi and Moscow will be able purchase it, the CEO of BrahMos Aerospace, Atul Rane, has told RT. The BrahMos weapon system has no parallel, Rane said in an interview published on Monday. It has massive advantages: speed; time; almost no defense against it. Another strength of the hardware is that it is a universal missile, the CEO explained. It s exactly the same missile which is launched from land, from sea, from sub-sea. And it s launchable from an air platform also. We ve been able to put the best of Russia and India together, Rane added, also expressing his belief that joint enterprises would serve as the future for major weapons projects. According to Rane, BrahMos is proof of the effectiveness of such cooperation. The Indian-Russian enterprise was established in 1998, with its first missile test flight taking place just three years later. A significant amount of time was saved because India and Russia shared technologies with each other, rather than having to invent them from scratch, the CEO explained. The development of BrahMos over the past two decades has seen its strike range increase to more than 250 miles (400km) from approximately 180 miles (290km). The missile travels at Mach 2.8 almost three times the speed of sound and is designed to destroy high-value targets such as warships or land-based command centers and bunkers. Everyone wants the BrahMos missile system, Rane insisted, noting that the Philippines would receive its first batch of missiles soon, while a deal with Indonesia is close to being concluded. According to the CEO, nations in South-East Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa have all expressed interest in purchasing the system. Well, who do we sell to? Well, it has to be sold to countries who are friendly to India and acceptable to the government of Russia also, he stated. ",https://www.rt.com/india/574926-india-brahmos-missile-rane/
"18 Apr, 2023",G7 announces terms for unfreezing Russian assets,"The funds will be released after the conflict with Kiev is resolved and Moscow pays for the damage, the bloc has announced Russian assets frozen by the G7 nations will remain immobilized until the Ukraine conflict is resolved and Moscow pays reparations, the group of leading western economies has announced. Any resolution to the conflict must ensure Russia pays for the damage it has caused, the bloc's foreign ministers stated following this week's meeting in Japan. The ministers also announced their intention to intensify the economic restrictions on Russia and to punish third parties for any attempts to evade and undermine our sanctions measures. They must cease assistance to Russia s war, or face severe costs, the G7 warned. The group, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and US, has condemned Moscow for launching its military operation in Ukraine in February 2022. The intragovernmental group of leading economies was formed in the 1970s, but its relative economic clout has since declined, as other nations, including Brazil, China, India, and South Africa, continue to grow. These four, along with Russia, form an informal group known as BRICS, which contributes more to global GDP than the G7 nations, according to British research firm Acorn Macro Consulting. The G7 has been one of the primary vehicles for formulating punitive actions, such as a price cap on Russian energy, which member states have sought to enforce through the threat of secondary sanctions against buyers that violate the restrictions. There have been claims in the media that Japan is buying Russian crude at prices over the prescribed cap of $60 per barrel. The US and its allies have frozen a reported $300 billion of Russian foreign reserves, as well as the assets of private individuals who they deem to be oligarchs that are close to the Russian government. Kiev and Washington want the frozen funds to go to post-war reconstruction efforts in Ukraine, but many Western nations have said that simply expropriating the money would violate their laws. Last week, the Russian central bank reported that the nation s foreign reserves once again surpassed the $600 billion benchmark. The all-time high was recorded on February 18, 2022, days before the Ukraine conflict broke out, when Russia possessed $643.2 billion in reserves. Russia rejects the Western claim that the military operation in Ukraine was unprovoked, saying it was in response to a proxy war against Moscow conducted by Washington to undermine competition on the world stage.

"18 Apr, 2023","Multipolarity is about a fair redistribution of power, which the West refuses to accept","An equitable world order is gaining momentum as tensions flare between the dominant and emerging world powers ByKanwal Sibal, retired Indian foreign secretary and former Ambassador to Russia between 2004 and 2007. He also held ambassadorial positions in Turkey, Egypt, France and wasDeputy Chief of Mission in Washington DC. ByKanwal Sibal, retired Indian foreign secretary and former Ambassador to Russia between 2004 and 2007. He also held ambassadorial positions in Turkey, Egypt, France and wasDeputy Chief of Mission in Washington DC. Multipolarity is a code word for more equitable power sharing in the world. Although global power, especially economic, has been dispersing in recent years, mainly towards the East, it is still not adequately reflected in decision-making on global issues. The West, led by the US, still dominates international political and financial institutions. It seeks to impose its values and norms on others and uses human rights and democracy as tools to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. It has not given up attempts to bring about regime change in other countries to further its geopolitical agenda. It is currently strengthening or building military alliances and partnerships to maintain its global leadership. It tries to shape narratives at the international level in its favor through the global information networks it controls. The power that the US exerts on all transactions in US dollars, along with the status of the US dollar as the world s reserve currency, arms Washington with a unique weapon for financial domination including its use of sanctions as an instrument to bend countries to its strategic goals. All of these deficiencies in global governance are epitomized in the unfolding of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia has been subject to a series of sanctions by the West without UN approval. Third countries are pressured to adhere to them under pain of secondary sanctions by the US. Losing access to the US financial markets is a risk that countries want to avoid. With multiple Russian banks arbitrarily excluded from the SWIFT payments system, bank transfer arrangements with Russia have been disrupted, affecting trade exchanges. Russian foreign exchange reserve holdings abroad have been illegally confiscated. Not only has the West broken oil and gas ties with Russia, other countries have been pressed to do so. A price cap on Russian oil has been imposed in a bid to limit Russian earnings from oil sales. The declared goal of these measures is to cause Russia s economic collapse. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has been blown up to end Germany s reliance on Russian gas. The property of private Russian individuals has been confiscated without due process of law, which casts doubt on the sanctity of private property in Western countries. Russian media has been banned in violation of Europe s commitment to freedom of speech as a fundamental value, and Western media has long been propagating narratives demonizing Russia and its President. The essence of multipolarity is multilateralism. However, the structures of multilateralism have not functioned well in the field of international security in particular and have been weakened further with the absence of reforms in the international political and economic institutions. The UN Security Council, the World Bank and the IMF still reflect the world of 1945 in many ways and require a thorough overhaul and modern restructuring. The UN Security Council needs to be expanded to give more representation to rising developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future with the deepening divisions between the West on one side and Russia and China on the other blocking even further an already difficult consensus from emerging. The expansion of the Security Council, in effect, constitutes a transfer of power at the international level, and this will continue to be resisted by the permanent powers for various reasons. Multilateralism means a willingness to accept the redistribution of global power that has already occurred on the ground, instead of looking for ways to limit its import by strengthening existing alliances and forging new ones, as is being seen today. The transatlantic alliance has been fortified, NATO expansion is taking place, Germany are Japan are rearming, US alliances in Asia are being reinforced, a new AUKUS alliance has been created and the Quad is being deepened as a platform. At the heart of this are the perceived threats from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine conflict, and from China emerging as a rival power economically, politically and militarily as well. Essentially, reinvigorating alliances is meant to constrain the emergence of multipolarity by limiting the growth of independent poles of power and their impact. The attempt is to recognise the shifts in power at the global level but consolidate this shift under the US umbrella as much as possible. The ambition of Europe to nurture an independent role, pushed at one time by France, has effectively been quashed for the time being. Russia, sensing its loss of power after the collapse of the Soviet Union and seeking to build a non-Western front against US unilateralism began a push for a multipolar world. It was prompted by US s promotion of color revolutions, regime changes, and even the break-up of countries to serve geopolitical ends, ostensibly in the name of democracy and human rights. The Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue platform, a concept initiated by former Russian foreign minister Evgeny Primakov back in 1998, was the first step in this direction. The RIC evolved into BRIC with the addition of Brazil and BRICS with the entry of South Africa. This gave a multi-continental base to the concept of multipolarity. BRICS has since been raised to summit level. Its agenda of institutional contacts and promotion of economic and financial cooperation has produced tangible results. Today, many countries seek BRICS membership such as Algeria, Argentina and Iran who have applied, while Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are potential members. Greater connectivity, transport, energy supplies, trade, alternative supply chains, and de-dollarization could all be promoted concretely under the aegis of BRICS. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) led by Russia and China is another forum to promote multipolarity. India is a member and will be hosting the SCO summit this year. Iran has been accepted as a new member, and according to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, a total of about 20 countries wish to join BRICS and the SCO. Western powers are notably absent from both BRICS and the SCO, allowing the organizations to identify spheres of cooperation and create structures together that provide more autonomy from the Western-dominated system in pursuing shared interests. The failure of the West to isolate Russia is evidence of growing multipolarity. Russia is weathering coercive sanctions. Its oil is flowing internationally despite Western embargoes. The strengthening of Russia-China strategic ties, India s readiness to expand its ties with Russia despite Western pressures, and New Delhi s refusal to condemn Russia on the Ukraine issue are other examples. African countries reaching out to Russia, China brokering peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Turkey, despite being a NATO member, refusing to sanction Russia and, indeed, expanding ties with it, flow also from the emergence of multipolarity in the international system. The increasing use of national currencies for trade rather than the US dollar promises to be a major step in that direction as well. There is no doubt that the current play of tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, especially its effects on the interests of the Global South, will give a boost to multipolarity. It is important, however, that multipolarity should function in a multilaterally cooperative, equitable and peaceful framework and not one of competitive power plays based on alliance systems and military tensions.

"17 Apr, 2023",Civilian deaths near 100 in Sudan clashes,"Intense fighting in Khartoum has entered a third day despite calls for ceasefire from world nations Bombardments and gunfire rage on in Sudan s capital Khartoum for a third day, with the civilian death toll rising to at least 97 and the number of injured at 365, according to data published on Monday by the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors.Clashes erupted on Saturday in the continuing power struggle between Abdel Fattah al-Burhan s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the influential paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.Three UN World Food Programme employees were among those killed in the violence, forcing the agency s operations in Sudan to be temporarily halted. The Indian Embassy there also announced on Sunday that one of its nationals working in a Dal Group Company in Sudan who got hit by a stray bullet on Saturday had succumbed to his injuries. Airlines including Qatar Airways and Kenya Airways have suspended flights to and from the conflict-torn country amid the fighting and the closure of Khartoum International Airport.Calls for a cease-fire have intensified, with Washington and London joining forces on Monday to urge for a return to negotiations in Khartoum. There is a shared deep concern about the fighting [and] violence that s going on in Sudan, the threat that that poses to civilians, that it poses to the Sudanese nation and potentially poses even to the region, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting in Japan alongside his British counterpart James Cleverly.Cleverly also said the immediate future of Sudan lies in the hands of the generals, calling on them to put peace first [and] get back to negotiations, emphasizing that that s what the people of Sudan deserve. Moscow had earlier voiced concern about the situation in Sudan and has encouraged the parties to the conflict to show political will and restraint and take prompt measures to cease fire. On Sunday, neighboring countries and regional bodies increased their efforts to bring an end to the violence in Sudan. Leaders from East Africa reportedly held an emergency virtual session and urged an immediate halt to hostilities between the conflicting parties. Additionally, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and South Sudanese President Salva Kiir expressed their willingness to mediate a resolution to the conflict, during a phone call.Meanwhile, the Sudanese army chief is said to have declared the RSF a rebel organisation on Monday and has given directives for its immediate dissolution.In 2019, a coup removed from power Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan for over 25 years. Since then the country has been under the leadership of the Transitional Sovereignty Council (TSC). However, the TSC was dissolved for a short period following another coup in 2021, before being reinstated. Recently, tensions have been rising between army chief and TSC chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also the deputy chairman of the body. Efforts to mediate these tensions have been unsuccessful, leading to the current conflict. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/574888-civilian-deaths-near-100-in-sudan-clashes/
"16 Apr, 2023",UN workers killed in Sudan violence,"Three humanitarian aid staff have died during the fighting between two branches of the country s security forces, an official said Three employees of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) have been killed killed and two more injured during armed clashes in Sudan, the international agency s executive director Cindy McCain said on Sunday. The agency has temporarily halted operations in the country, she added. UN workers were slain on Saturday in the Kabkabiya District in the western part of the country, McCain said. She added that a WFP-operated aircraft was significantly damaged at Khartoum International Airport the same day. Any loss of life in humanitarian service is unacceptable and I demand immediate steps to guarantee the safety of those who remain, McCain said, adding that aid workers are neutral and should never be a target. While we review the evolving security situation, we are forced to temporarily halt all operations in Sudan, the WFP boss announced. On Saturday, clashes broke out in the capital Khartoum and other cities between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), an independent security branch with roots in pro-government militias. Each side has accused the other of starting hostilities. In 2019, Omar al-Bashir, Sudan s ruler of more than 25 years, was overthrown in a coup. The country has since been governed by the Transitional Sovereignty Council (TSC) that was briefly dissolved and then reinstated in the wake of another coup in 2021. The current conflict comes after a failed attempt to mediate growing tensions between army chief and TSC chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also the body s deputy chairman. Fighting was reported around the airport and the presidential palace, as well as around military bases. Dagalo claimed on Sky News Arabia on Saturday that his troops were in control of more than 90% of strategic sites in Khartoum. The Sudan Tribune, meanwhile, cited a SAF statement on Sunday as saying that the army has captured seven RSF bases across the country, including one in the capital. Egypt and South Sudan, sharing a border with Sudan, have called for a ceasefire. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi spoke over the phone with his South Sudanese counterpart, Salva Kiir, on Sunday. The leaders expressed readiness to mediate the end of the conflict, according to Sisi s spokesman, Ahmad Fahmy. At least 56 civilians were killed as of Sunday and 595 people, including soldiers, wounded, the Sudanese Doctors Union said, as cited by Al Jazeera.

"14 Apr, 2023",Brazil calls for 'move away' from dollar,"President Lula da Silva has kicked off his first state visit to China with a BRICS bank event Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has stated that developing nations should move away from the US dollar in favor of their own currencies in order to push back against American dominance over the global financial system. Speaking in Shanghai on Thursday during an official visit to China, Lula said the BRICS group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa should look for an alternative currency to the dollar for trade. Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar. Why can t we do trade based on our own currencies? hesaid. Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard? The leftist leader went on to lament that everyone depends on just one currency, referring to the dollar, and proposed a currency to finance trade relations between Brazil and China, between Brazil and other countries. Lula kicked off his trip to China with an event to mark the appointment of former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff as the head of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, which he said could free emerging economies from submission to traditional financial institutions, which want to govern us. Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad also traveled with the president to China, where hetold reportersthat Brazil would aim to create trade mechanisms for developing countries to bypass the use of the dollar. The advantage is to avoid the straitjacket imposed by necessarily having trade operations settled in a currency of a country not involved in the transaction, he said. Lula s visit to China comes as Beijing increasingly promotes the use of its own currency, the renminbi, to settle international transactions. Last month, Russia said it hadadopted the yuanas one of its primary reserve currencies amid a massive sanctions campaign linked to the conflict in Ukraine, highlighting a gradual shift away from the Western financial system by some major powers. Trade between China and Brazil has seen a significant boost over the last decade, with more than $150 billion in business recorded last year. Chinese firms have bought up large amounts of minerals and agricultural goods in the South American country, and invested in Brazilian infrastructure. The Brazilian president arrived in China on Wednesday night and will remain there until April 15. After his speech in Shanghai, Lula headed off to Beijing, where he is set to meet with President Xi Jinping on Friday. The two leaders are expected to focus on issues related to trade and foreign policy such as China s Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to develop roads, highways and other infrastructure in foreign countries according to the Financial Times.

"14 Apr, 2023",India s new foreign trade policy aims to smash dollar s hegemony,"The Chinese yuan may be the perfect foil for the rupee to usher in a new multipolar order for global trade ByJoydeep Sen Gupta, Asia Editor India s newforeign trade policy, which took effect on April 1, seeks to pivot away from the US dollar s hegemony and promote the country s own own national currency, the rupee, in a bid toboostexports and conserve its foreign exchange reserves. In 2022, India s exports were $453.3 billion, a14.6%uptick year-on-year, despite a slowdown in globaltrade. India became the fifth-largest economy in the worldlast Septemberat $3.18 trillion, even though the Covid-19 pandemic slowed it s march towards$5 trillionby another two years. Amid a robust economicgrowthoutlook, India is poised to trade in rupees with countries that are facing an acute shortage of dollars, according to the country s commerce secretary, Sunil Barthwal. Santosh Kumar Sarangi, head of the directorate-general of foreign trade (DGFT), has spelled out a national goal of $2 trillion in exports of merchandise and services by 2030. Additionally, India will launch a new amnesty scheme for one-time settlement of defaults on export obligations, Sarangi said. The scheme, which will remain operational till September, aims for quicker resolution of trade disputes. The rupee s global push got a shot in the arm after 18 countries including Russia, Germany, Singapore, Israel, and the UK agreed to trade in the Indian national currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country s central bank, recently gave its approval to these countries to pay for imported goods in rupees. The move will reduce India s ballooning trade deficit of $233 billion between April 2022 and January 2023. India s trade with its south Asian neighbors such as Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka will also grow asBRICSmembers push to de-dollarize the global market. Last month, the Indian government announced that the RBI had cleared 60 requests from various banks in these 18 nations to open Special Vostro Rupee Accounts (SVRAs) that allow foreign banks to settle payments in rupees. Indian importers will make payments in rupees that will be credited to theSVRAsof the foreign correspondent bank, and exporters will receive payment from the SVRAs of their foreign partners. India s central bank has also given the nod for the surplus rupee balance in these SVRAs to be used for payments on projects and investments, import advance flow management, and investments in government securities. The RBI s new norms augur well for India, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20 this year. New Delhi would like to use this elite world economic club to push for international trade settlement in rupees, Barthwal said. He believes the rupee trade will help several developing and less developed economies that are facing currency issues.' A broad consensus on these lines emerged during the first Trade and Investment Working Group (TIWG) meeting of the G20 that was held in Mumbai, India in late March. As economies around the world especially emerging ones feel the spillover effect of US monetary tightening, the debate is being reignited on ending the dollar s dominance in global trade. Another key factor is Washington s ability to use its currency as a potent tool for political blackmail and coercion against nations it sees as adversaries. From Cuba to Iran to Syria to Russia, the US has been accused of arbitrarily imposing sanctions on nations to further its own economic interests while pursuing irresponsible monetary policies. Several expertshave citedthe weaponization of the dollar as a likely trigger that could bring an end to its dominance as the world s most powerful currency. The call to ditch the US dollar has intensified following US sanctions on Russia due to the Ukraine conflict that started in February 2022. The punitive measures led to overseas assets of Russia s financial institutions being frozen and multiple major Russian banks being cut off from the SWIFT system. This was an indication for the rest of the world, including India and China, of the growing risks of the US using the dollar for its geopolitical and expansionist gains. A new arrangement is needed, and currencies such as the Chinese yuan have an opportunity to play an important role in providing such an alternative. Plans are afoot by many nations to ensure the SWIFT system becomes less relevant through innovative financial mechanisms that are gathering momentum. These measures would limit the system as a tool for the US and its coercive tactics. For instance, during the meeting of all ASEAN finance ministers and central bank governors in Bali, Indonesia on March 30, topping the agenda were discussions about reducing financial transaction dependence on the US dollar, euro, yen, and pound sterling and alternatively making payments in regional currencies. In January, South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor was quoted as saying in an interview with Sputnik that the emerging economies of BRICS would like to find a way of bypassing the US dollar and creating a mechanism that would not be skewed towards wealthier Western nations. Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Mohammed Al-JadaanechoedPandor in January, saying the oil-rich sheikhdom would be open to talks about settling petroleum trade in currencies other than the US dollar. Though India has been working overtime to push the rupee for its global trade, the realities are far from ideal, as the currency has considerably weakened in the past year. In the case of India-Russia bilateral trade, which has been rapidlygrowingsince the Ukraine conflict started, New Delhi has found a viable alternative. India and Russia have decided to route goods through third countries such as the UAE, which enjoys healthy ties with both the nations, and also because the emirates currency the dirham is pegged to the dollar, and as a result, the dirham enjoys global stability. Both nations have come to the understanding that this is the best way to engage in bilateral trade and also avoid trading in rupees, rubles and dollars. However, the new approachcontradictsthe Indian government s bid to settle international trade in rupees in line with an announcement made last July. The rupee-ruble payment mechanism is proving to be tough going so far because of thegrowing tradeimbalance between India and Russia and several other teething issues. Russian banks such as Sberbank and Gazprombank, which have operations in India, are also not in favor of Indian rupees piling up. Besides, the rupee lost7.8%in the last financial year, the most since 2019-20, and it was one of the worst performing Asian currencies falling more than 10% in 2022. It ended this past fiscal year in March at 82.18 to a dollar. Given such volatility, using the UAE dirham appears to be a reasonable solution tohelpfacilitate a further ramping up of bilateral trade. Another important area where de-dollarization trends are being observed is American debt. While statistics on foreign holdings of US Treasuries for any given month or even year may simply reflect the vicissitudes of markets and the relative strength of the dollar, the long-term secular trend is of foreign central banks scooping up less American debt than they once did. For decades, foreign countries sterilized a significant share of US deficits meaning the US ran deficits that it financed with dollar-denominated debt, which other countries bought in large quantities. However, this arrangement a key component of the special status the dollar has enjoyed has begun being chipped away at in recent years. In fact, since 2014, foreigners have been consistent net sellers of Treasuries. Prominent American fund manager Luke Gromen hasnotedthat between 2002 and 2014, foreign central banks bought 53% of all US Treasuries issued; from 2014-2022 that figure is just 3%. China, in fact, announced in 2013 that henceforth it would not grow its balances of US Treasuries and has been a net seller of Treasuries for over a decade. This trend is likely set to continue. And with less trade being settled in dollars, there will be fewer dollars to be recycled into traditional reserve assets such as US Treasuries. India and China have initiated the move to de-dollarize global trade with Russia, while Brazil is joining the party and South Africa is waiting in the wings. The initiative connects the BRICS trade dots. Indiahas paidRussia in UAE dirhams for its crude oil purchases and saved an estimated$3.6 billionin the process. The yuan has in recent years established itself as a major global currency that is poised to contribute to the dislodging of the dollar from its position of supremacy. The yuan is now the fifth most used currency in payments, third largest in trade settlements and fifth largest reserve currency. To make matters worse for several developing countries, there has been an exponentialrisein dollar borrowing costs, holding back the growth of their foreign trade. This is where comparatively low-cost yuan financing could further boost the Chinese currency s global visibility. The yuan joined the IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR) basket in October 2016, and since then the currency s strength has grown significantly. IMF data showed that yuan accounted for 12.28% of the SDR last year. With Beijing working overtime to make a currency play as the world s second-largest economy, the prevailing dollar-dependent scenario could change in the next couple of years. China s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), which is a viable alternative to SWIFT, and its digital currency (e-CNY) promises to become a dominant payment system to further trade between Beijing and its partners such as the Global South. The e-CNY could emerge as the significant reserve currency, which would break the dollar hegemony. The Indian rupee could double down as a foil to the Chinese currency in a multipolar world. De-dollarization is likely to become a reality in a new global order, where the US won t have the last word based on its economic might.Historically, it s the decline of the currency that portends the decline of hegemony. And the dollar could be the epitaph for US imperialism.",https://www.rt.com/india/574551-india-foreign-trade-dollar/
"12 Apr, 2023",Putin warrant could derail BRICS summit South Africa,"Though a close partner of Moscow, Pretoria is legally obliged to enforce the International Criminal Court s summons The International Criminal Court s (ICC) warrant for the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin has thrown a spanner in the works of an upcoming BRICS summit in South Africa, a spokesman for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday. As a signatory to the 2002 Rome Statute, South Africa is obliged to enforce the ICC s warrant for Putin s arrest. However, the country is also hosting this year s BRICS summit in August, at which the leaders of the world s largest emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are due to meet. All heads of state would be expected to attend the summit. But now we have a spanner in the works in the form of this ICC warrant, Ramaphosa s spokesman told reporters. What that dictates is that there be further engagements in terms of how that is going to be managed, and those engagements are underway, he continued. Once they've been concluded, the necessary announcements will be made. Ramaphosa s government has been aware of the dilemma surrounding the warrant since its issue, with Magwenya last month declining to say whether Pretoria would enforce it. Ramaphosaannouncedon Tuesday that he would dispatch an envoy to Washington to clarify his non-aligned stance on the Ukraine conflict. South Africa and Russia have been close partners since the Soviet Union backed the anti-apartheid African National Congress, which today is led by Ramaphosa. Under his leadership, South Africa has refused to condemn Russia s military operation in Ukraine or impose sanctions on Moscow, while the country s military took part in joint exercises with Russian and Chinese forces earlier this year. Pretoria has its own issues with the ICC, and was chastised by the court in 2017 for failing to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he visited the country in 2015 for an African leaders summit. Following the incident, South African officials applied to withdraw from the court, a decision that was later reversed after a High Court ruling determined that such a move was unconstitutional. In issuing the warrant, the court accused Putin and Russian Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova of the unlawful deportation of children from occupied areas of Ukraine. The charges refer to Russia s efforts to evacuate civilians away from areas mostly in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Donbass shelled by the Ukrainian military. Russia which like the US, China, and India, does not recognize the court s authority has dismissed the warrant as null and void from the legal standpoint.

"11 Apr, 2023",BRICS nation to clarify Russia stance with Washington,"South Africa says a delegation will engage and persuade stakeholders on its bipartisan response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict South Africa s President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that he will dispatch an envoy to Washington to clarify Pretoria's stance on Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. According to Obed Bapela, Deputy Minister in the Presidency for Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, the move comes in response to criticism of South Africa's""non-participant""and non-aligned position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the country's longstanding relationship with Moscow. President Putin is scheduled to visit South Africa in August for the 15th BRICS Summit — and concerns have been expressed about whether Pretoria intends to act on the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant issued against the Russian leader for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The South African Communist Party, in an April statement, asserted that the timing of the arrest warrant, issued just before Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia in March, indicated a political motivation and historical inconsistency. Unfortunately, imperialist powers continue to manipulate this multilateral institution and use it for judicial imperialism, the SACP wrote in a statement, according to local outlet News24. The party added that despite many calls, and ample evidence, the ICC has consistently refused to charge the likes of Netanyahu, Bush, Clinton, Blair and Obama who have destroyed countries and killed thousands of people. In 2017, the ICC found South Africa in breach of its obligations by failing to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he visited the country in 2015 for an African leaders summit. As a signatory to the Rome Statute establishing the court, Pretoria has sought legal advice on how to deal with the ICC order against Putin. According to the presidency, the planned visit to Washington, which is not a member of the ICC, will allow South Africa to""engage and persuade""regarding its Russia position. Although the identity of the envoy heading the delegation has not been revealed, Bapela said that its members will be highly experienced and may include former ministers.

"9 Apr, 2023",Saudis arrive for Yemen peace talks,"An almost nine-year conflict has led to one of the world s worst humanitarian crises Delegates representing Saudi Arabia and Oman arrived in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Saturday to discuss a permanent ceasefire to end the civil war which has raged in the country since 2014. The fighting is being waged primarily between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels both of whom claim to be the country s official leaders along with their various allies. The Houthi-operated Saba news agency reported on Sunday that the Saudi and Omani envoys will attempt to negotiate with Houthi officials to end the fighting, bring to a close Riyadh s military involvement, and lift the siege with all its repercussions. Saba also said the talks are aimed at restoring the rights of Yemeni citizens, including the payment of state salaries with revenue derived from oil and gas. The lifting of a Saudi-imposed blockade on Yemeni ports will also be discussed, as well as the establishment of a timeline for foreign military forces to leave the country, Reuters reported. Omani officials are mediating the talks, which come alongside UN efforts to establish peace in the region. The discussions follow Saudi Arabia and Iran s decision to re-establish diplomatic ties, at talks recently brokered by China. The Houthis are an Iran-aligned Shia militant group which seized Sanaa in 2014, as well as much of the north of the country. The previous, internationally recognized government fled south, and later into exile in Saudi Arabia. In 2015, Riyadh led a coalition of nine countries from West Asia and North Africa to intervene in the civil war on behalf of the ousted government, launching bombing campaigns and later a naval blockade. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of supplying weapons to the Houthis. Tehran denies this, but admits backing the rebel cause. The conflict has been described as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The UN has estimated that by the end of 2021 more than 377,000 people had died during the conflict, either by direct or indirect means. Around 80% of Yemen s population is thought to be dependent on foreign aid. The civil war has led to what has been described as one of the world s worst humanitarian disasters. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia agreed to release 13 Houthi prisoners in exchange for one Saudi captive. Further prisoner swaps are expected. The detainees released today from Saudi prisons are part of the deal agreed via the United Nations, and next Thursday the deal will be fully implemented, Houthi official Abdul-Qader el-Murtaza told Reuters on Saturday.

Mahmoud bin Mabrouk cited unnamed sources in the North African country s government as saying the option of joining the organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa is being considered among the other possibilities. I have information that Tunisia is seriously considering joining the BRICS group, bin Mabrouk said. Earlier this week, Tunisian President Kais Saied spoke out against foreign diktats from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is in stalled talks over a bailout package for the cash-stripped nation. The head of state highlighted that the terms of a $2 billion loan deal proposed by the Washington-based organisation would worsen the poverty crisis in the heavily indebted country. The deal, which was supposed to be approved in December 2022, was postponed after Tunisia failed to meet key commitments. The IMF has pushed the government to remove state subsidies on basic goods, including food and energy, and reduce the public wage bill. The government of Tunisia, which is on the brink of a full-blown balance of payments crisis, has proposed a 26.4% cut in subsidy expenditure to $2.89 billion in its 2023 budget. However, it has not raised fuel prices this year, apparently to avoid public anger after inflation reached 10.3%, the highest level in four decades.

"9 Apr, 2023",BRICS carries greater economic weight than G7 study,"The bloc of five developing countries has a larger share of global GDP than the Group of Seven major economies, research finds The BRICS group, comprising the world s five major developing economies, has overtaken the Group of Seven (G7) by making up a larger share of the global gross domestic product (GDP) based on purchasing power parity, data compiled by Acorn Macro Consulting, a UK-based macroeconomic research firm, shows. According to the findings, the bloc of BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, contributes 31.5% of the world s GDP. Meanwhile, the G7, consisting of the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK, and considered the most advanced economic bloc of countries on the planet, add up to 30.7%. The gap between the two groups is expected to continue to grow, analysts say, as China and India are experiencing robust economic growth, and more countries are interested in joining BRICS. Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that more than a dozen nations have expressed an interest in joining BRICS, including Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bangladesh have acquired equity in the New Development Bank, BRICS funding organization. Last year, BRICS countries proposed creating their own currency in order to move away from the US dollar and the euro in mutual transactions. International settlements in those currencies were made difficult for Russia, a BRICS founding member, by Ukraine-related sanctions. More recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the use of the Chinese yuan in transactions with BRICS allies and other international partners in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

"8 Apr, 2023",Ukraine will 'disappear' Medvedev,"Nobody in the world, even its own citizens, really cares about country 404, the former Russian president claims Ukraine will disappear because its Western backers, the rest of the world, and even its own citizens have no need for the troubled country to keep existing, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has implied. Why would Ukraine disappear? Because nobody needs it, Medvedev, who now holds the position of deputy head of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on the VK social network on Saturday. The EU doesn t need Ukraine because supporting the country amid the conflict with Russia on the order of their American mentor, plunged the Europeans into a real financial and political hell, he insisted. Detrimental anti-Russia sanctions, spiking inflation, high energy prices and the decay of businesses have already led to protests in various parts of the continent, the official pointed out. The prospect of decisively planting Ukrainian blood-sucking parasites on the neck of the shriveling EU is real and, if it happens, it s going to signal the demise of the bloc, Medvedev warned. Kiev s prime backer, the US, doesn t need Ukraine either, because most ordinary Americans have no idea where it s located and consider it some abstract part of Russia, the post read. They wonder why the establishment in the US isn t trying to deal with inflation and [the lack of] jobs or emergencies in their home states, but is instead occupied with this 404 country, the former president wrote, referring to the 404 error protocol in network communications. Only political demagogues in Washington, who have long conceded their impotence and dementia, are trying to make PR gains from military and sanctions campaigns, he added. Africa and Latin America reject Ukraine because the billions that the US is wasting on senseless battles somewhere in Ukraine would ve been enough to fund many social-development programs in those regions, Medvedev wrote. Asian countries don t need Ukraine because, through the example of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, they see how the technologies of color revolutions are being developed to eliminate the largest competing powers. They understand what scenario the collective West, led by the US, has prepared for them in case of disobedience, the official explained. Besides, Russia is much closer to such nations as China and India in a geopolitical sense and has historically proven to be their reliable partner, he added. Russia doesn t need Ukraine because the country is a mistake created by the collapse of the Soviet Union, Medvedev also claimed. Millions of our compatriots, who live here, have for many years been subjected to abuse by the Nazi Kiev regime. It s them that we re protecting in the course of a special military operation, his post read. Finally, Ukraine, with its Nazi elite at the helm, is not needed by its own citizens. That s why, out of 45 million, a little more than 20 million people remain there now, he wrote. The Ukrainians don t want to help President Vladimir Zelensky and his associates put even more stolen Western money in their offshore accounts; instead, they re eager to move to Poland or elsewhere in the EU, to become the 52nd state of the US or even join the penguins in Antarctica, Medvedev concluded.

"6 Apr, 2023",350 exotic animals found in airport luggage (VIDEO),"The live cargo was illegally brought to Moscow by a smuggler from South Africa, the Russian customs service said The Russian Customs Service (FTS) has seized a consignment of more than 350 exotic animals and insects from a Russian national, who tried to smuggle them into the country from South Africa. The animals and insects were intercepted at Moscow s Domodedovo Airport, the service said on Thursday. The specimens were transported in plastic containers in the smuggler s luggage. The man claimed that had personally caught the animals in South Africa and planned to keep them at home, but the service established that he was actually seeking to sell them online. It was not immediately clear whether he actually caught them all or procured them from local illegal traders. The haul included various exotic animals, including 14 pygmy chameleons and other lizards, five toads, as well as assorted insects, including giant centipedes, woodlice, and cockroaches, according to the FTS. Some of the animals did not make it to Russia alive, having perished during the trip due to sharp temperature changes and inept transportation, the service stated. The seized specimens were handed over to animal rights activists for temporary keeping, and they are now receiving proper care and veterinary attention. The incident may be part of a larger-scale scheme, the FTS noted, as it was already linked to a failed smuggling attempt foiled last December, when a woman traveling from the Philippines was caught with 150 live animals concealed in her luggage at one of Moscow s airports.

"6 Apr, 2023",Kenya faults West for making climate change poor man s problem,"President Ruto said Africa is the least responsible for global warming but most exposed to the consequences Kenyan President William Ruto has called out the West for pushing African countries away from fossil fuels while failing to provide adequate financial resources for the parallel development of renewable energies. Speaking at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue (BETD) earlier this week, Ruto said that, instead of making climate change a poor man s problem, genuine partnership is needed to address the crisis. The West has been pushing for abandonment of any fossil-fuel projects. However, countries like Uganda and Tanzania have been defending their oil pipeline project meant to harvest oil resources in Uganda s Lake Albert region for export. It is both a problem and a solution for Africa, and richer countries need to invest in it, Ruto said. He said Africa faces multiple intertwined crises and is the continent most vulnerable to climate change and its impacts despite being the least responsible for the climate-change crisis. In November 2022, the World Health Organization reported that the number of climate-related health emergencies in the greater Horn of Africa had reached an all-time high, exacerbating a health crisis in a region where 47 million people already face acute hunger. Between January 1 and 30 October 30 last year, 39 outbreaks, flooding, and other acute public health events were reported in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda, according to the report. Outbreaks of anthrax, measles, cholera, yellow fever, chikungunya, meningitis, and other infectious diseases account for more than 80% of reported acute public-health events, with drought, flooding, and other disasters accounting for the remainder. At the BETD forum, President Ruto noted that Africa has the least energy access, with over 600 million Africans still without access to energy. He added that the continent is still carrying the scars of colonialism as well as economic and institutional dependencies that followed it. The 2015 Paris Agreement sets up a global framework for avoiding dangerous climate change by keeping global warming well below 2 C and pursuing efforts to keep it below 1.5 C. It intends to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. However, according to Ruto, the rollout of renewable energy in Africa is slow, owing to difficulties in obtaining financing for their development. He stated that Africa s assets and ability to leapfrog technologically make the continent, and particularly Kenya, a critical partner in navigating the next era of global energy transition.

"6 Apr, 2023",Spain to invest in South African green projects Bloomberg,"Madrid will provide $2.3 billion loan for Cape Town s transition from coal, the outlet has said Spain has promised to provide 2.1 billion ($2.3 billion) in loans and grants for South Africa's energy transition and water projects to help the continent s most industrialized country shift away from coal, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The deal requires a 30% return to Spanish companies in the form of equity or procurement. The funding will focus on projects in solar and wind energy, and will finance green hydrogen and electric vehicle production, as well as water and sanitation projects. South Africa is among the world s most coal-dependent countries, with 80% of its electricity derived from the fossil fuel. At least 100,000 jobs in the country depend directly on coal. Meanwhile, the nation s worn-out and badly maintained coal-fired power plants are struggling to meet peak energy demand, leading to rolling blackouts in recent years. The funds will be provided through discounted loans, risk insurance and capital investments, according to Spanish Ambassador to South Africa Raimundo Robredo Rubio. Madrid has promised to provide 15 million ($16.4 million) in grants for feasibility studies. This is the first time in history we have done something like this, Robredo said in an interview. In October 2022, the Spanish government s development finance institution Cofides signed a cooperation agreement with South Africa s Industrial Development Corp (IDC) to accelerate the nation s green transition. However, the amount of investment and funding instruments have yet to be finalized. According to Robredo, capital investment will be managed together with Cofides and the IDC, with clear exit prices and dates, Robredo said. He added that, while green projects would be fully financed, the deal requires a 30% return to Spanish companies in the form of equity or procurement. The Spanish initiative follows a separate $8.5 billion funding package from the EU, the UK and the US. Known as South Africa s Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), the project has been presented as a pioneering example of how wealthy nations can help developing countries to cut their dependence on coal. Meanwhile, the South African government has criticized the structure of the JETP finance package, saying it relies too heavily on loans that will add to the country s debt burden.

"5 Apr, 2023",South Africa ends power crisis state of emergency ,"The disaster regulations had been in place for almost two months South Africa has lifted the state of emergency declared in February to deal with the country s crippling electricity crisis. The measure had been a necessary response to the economic impact and harm caused by critical levels of load shedding on vulnerable sectors, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Thembi Nkadimeng said in a statement on Wednesday. President Cyril Ramaphosa invoked the measure on February 9 to address the crisis, during which there were daily rolling power cuts by state utility Eskom due to frequent breakdowns at its coal-fired power stations. According to Nkadimeng, the state of emergency granted the government greater authority to manage the crisis, including the ability to procure emergency resources with fewer bureaucratic hurdles and less oversight. He said the country will now rely on existing laws and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of power cuts through its Energy Crisis Committee. As part of these efforts, the newly appointed Minister of Electricity, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, has visited Eskom s power stations in recent weeks for consultations. Eskom s exemption from the Public Finance Management Act was recently revoked in order for additional consultations with the auditor-general and Eskom s auditors to be carried out. The government has said that this decision, among other developments, influenced the ending of the state of emergency. The use of state of emergency legislation to manage South Africa s electricity crisis was criticized by some analysts and even challenged in court by the non-profit Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), which contended that the crisis could have been handled using existing laws.

"4 Apr, 2023",South Africa braces for energy reforms,"The country has been suffering from rolling blackouts for years South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has offered solutions to tackle a severe electricity crisis, as the country is facing an economic meltdown due to its chronic energy problems. Africa s most-industrialized nation has been suffering from rolling blackouts every day this year, as Eskom Holdings, the state company that supplies about 90% of the country s electricity, fails to meet demand from its worn-out plants. In an effort to address the unprecedented power shortages, Ramaphosa has appointed the country s first electricity minister, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, and tasked him with reducing outages, improving Eskom s plant performance and accelerating the procurement of additional generation capacity. Ramaphosa has stated that the new minister will remain in office for as long as needed to resolve the energy crisis. The president has also declared a state of disaster, which will give the government the power to release resources to tackle the crisis while skirting bureaucratic procedures. It will enable us to accelerate energy projects and limit regulatory requirements while maintaining rigorous environmental protections, procurement principles and technical standards, he stated in his February address to the nation. Ramaphosa added that the state of disaster would enable the government to provide support for businesses in the food production, storage and retail supply chain. The measures will include the rollout of generators and solar panels to secure uninterrupted power supply. Much of the country has been experiencing rolling blackouts for years. Eskom s performance has deteriorated to the point that less than half of its capacity has been regularly available. By late February, the company reported that out of a total of 54 gigawatts (GW) of installed power, 23 GW were offline and more than 19 GW were out of service due to unplanned breakdowns, and another 4.2 GW down for planned maintenance.

"4 Apr, 2023",US trying to disrupt Africa summit Moscow,"Washington wants to persuade countries not to attend an international forum in St. Petersburg in July, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said Washington is seeking to sabotage the upcoming summit involving Russia and African countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday. Speaking to the newspaper Argumenty i Fakty, the minister stated that the US and its vassals are doing everything they can to bring about the international isolation of Russia. They are trying to torpedo the second Russia-Africa summit that is planned for the end of July in St. Petersburg by persuading our African friends not to participate, the diplomat added. The first such gathering was held in 2019 in the Russian Black Sea resort city of Sochi, and was attended by officials from all 54 African countries. According to Lavrov, there are less and less of those willing to sacrifice their core interests for the sake of Washington and its lackeys, to carry water for former colonial powers. That is why attempts to hamper our cooperation with the countries of the Global South and the East will continue, but their success is far from guaranteed, Lavrov said. Our main difference from the West is that we never lecture foreign partners on how they ought to live. We don t have a hidden agenda. We don t employ double standards. We manage interactions between the states on the principles of international law, equality, mutual respect, and the consideration of [another s] interests. I believe Africans find this constructive approach appealing. Lavrov said Russia plans to use the July summit in St. Petersburg to discuss the economic development of Africa, including joint projects in infrastructure, mining, the digital sector, and agriculture. Moscow s top diplomat visited South Africa, Eswatini, Angola, and Eritrea in January. The following month, he traveled to Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan. Some Western officials have warned African nations against dealing with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron accused Moscow last year of trying to exert influence on the continent by predatory means. In August, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the UN, said African countries stand the chance of having actions taken against them if they violate sanctions imposed on Russia.

We were advised at this point in time that [parole] has been denied and it will be considered again in one year s time, a legal representative of Steenkamp s family told AFP on Friday. It was also confirmed that Pistorius has not yet served the minimum term which would make him eligible for parole. The confusion over whether he was eligible for parole is apparently due to various appeals which had broken up his incarceration, as well as a period of house arrest. Steenkamp s parents, June and Barry, have maintained that they do not believe Pistorius version of events and don t believe he is remorseful or rehabilitated. While we welcome today s decision, today is not a cause for celebration, they said through their lawyer, Tania Koen. The former athlete has consistently denied that he intended to cause harm to Steenkamp. Pistorius was initially found guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide in 2014 but this was later upgraded to murder following protests by women s rights groups, and an appeal by prosecutors. He was handed a 13-year sentence in 2017.

He reached the semi-finals of the 400m event in the English capital. The initial televised trial drew widespread public attention in South Africa and abroad.

The move could reportedly challenge the country s decades-old agreement with South African diamond giant De Beers. Masisi said that Botswana s state gem trader will supply HB Antwerp with precious stones for five years. The announcement comes as the Southern African nation has been negotiating a new agreement with De Beers, under which most of the country's gems would be mined by a joint venture. Botswana is Africa s leading diamond producer and the second-largest worldwide after Russia. Sales of the diamonds would still be handled by the South African company. However, Masisi reportedly threatened to walk away from the talks and praised how HB Antwerp handles the diamonds extracted at Botswana s Karowe Mine, which is owned by Canadian mining company Lucara Diamond. Masisi has previously warned that his country would abandon talks over the new sales deal and the extension of De Beers mining rights in the country unless Botswana were given a larger share of revenues. De Beers' mining rights expire in 2029, while the diamond sales agreement ends in June 2023. Under the current deal, Debswana, a joint venture between De Beers and the Botswana government, will sell 75% of its output to De Beers, while 25% goes to the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company. Formed in 1968, Debswana supplies more than two thirds of De Beers diamonds, and revenue from the precious stones accounts for more than 30% of Botswana s GDP.

"25 Mar, 2023",Economic cost of natural disasters estimated,"Worldwide losses topped $275 billion last year, according to a new insurance analysis Natural disasters resulted in global economic losses of $275 billion last year, of which $125 billion was covered by insurance, according to an annualreportby the Swiss Re Institute. The publication, which was issued on Wednesday, showed that 2022 was the second consecutive year in which insured losses from natural catastrophes exceeded the $100 billion mark. The staggering number was due to Hurricane Ian in Florida, hail storms in France, floods in Australia and South Africa, winter storms in Europe and the US, as well as droughts in Europe, China and the Americas, the insurance company reports. The magnitude of losses in 2022 is not a story of exceptional natural hazards, but rather a picture of growing property exposure, accentuated by exceptional inflation, said Martin Bertogg, the head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re. While inflation may subside, increasing value concentration in areas vulnerable to natural catastrophes remains a key driver for increasing losses, he added. According to the report, 2022 insured losses were largely driven by Hurricane Ian, which was by far the year s costliest event. Making landfall in Florida in September as a category 4 storm, Ian reportedly resulted in estimated insured losses of $50 65 billion. At the same time, a cluster of storms (Eunice, Dudley, Franklin) in northwestern Europe in February 2022 led to combined insured losses of over $4 billion, bringing the total for the category to almost double the previous 10-year average. Meanwhile, France saw the highest ever annual loss of $5 billion from hailstorms, according to the report. The insurer also highlighted that global losses from floods were above average. The flooding in eastern Australia in February-March 2022 reportedly resulted in insured losses of $4.3 billion. Swiss Re pointed out that there has been a 5 7% average annual increase in insured losses from natural catastrophes over the past three decades.

As long as we are needed by our nation, we will fight on the territory of Ukraine,""Prigozhin said in a statement published on Telegram, responding to questions put by Russian media outlet URA.ru. On Thursday, Bloomberg claimed that ammunition and personnel shortages had prompted Prigozhin to""shift focus back to Africa.""The media outlet also repeatedly pointed to the fact that Wagner Group forces had still failed to fully seize the strategic Ukrainian city of Artyomovsk, referred to as Bakhmut in Ukraine. The city has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting during Russia s military operation, and has remained a major stronghold for the Ukrainian military since Kiev initiated the fighting in Donbass in 2014. The Wagner Group has been the primary force behind a series of successful operations that have seen settlements around Artyomovsk captured by Russian forces in recent months. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky insisted that the strategically vital city would not be surrendered under any circumstances as the Wagner Group was closing in on it from the north, south and east. Zelensky recently changed his tune, arguing that it would be held only as long as it remained""reasonable""to do so.

The case, which alleges unlawful dismissal and was filed by 43 former employees, was announced on Monday. The case targets the social media company and its contractors for firing the entire workforce. It also accuses Meta of blacklisting all the fired workers, according to a statement cited by local media. Meta, which includes WhatsApp and Instagram, has reduced its workforce by around 25% in less than six months, as the tech industry struggles amid high interest rates and record inflation. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the latest cuts of 10,000 to its global workforce last week. The Kenyan content moderators were employed through third-party company Sama, and accused Meta and its partners of discrimination and violation of their rights. In January, 260 content moderators working at Facebook s moderation hub in Nairobi, Kenya, were told that they would be made redundant by Sama, the outsourcing firm that has run the office since 2019, the statement read. It added that the moderators were engaged in critical safety work for East and South Africa, but lost their jobs overnight. Content moderators are in charge of sifting through materials which include violence, child pornography, and terrorist propaganda. They review posts that include graphic images of rape, child molestation, and murder. A Kenyan NGO and two Ethiopian citizens filed a complaint against Meta in December of last year, alleging that the platform was not doing enough to combat online hate. They also called for the creation of a $1.6 billion compensation fund for victims. In their court petition, the plaintiffs claimed that daily exposure to such content had left many moderators with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Phillip Luhl, a Namibian, and his Mexican partner, Guillermo Delgado, are listed as parents on the South African birth certificate of four-year-old Yona. In late 2021, the Namibian High Court granted the child nationality after the Ministry of Home Affairs denied it on technical grounds. The government filed an appeal, arguing that the birth had not been registered with the Namibian authorities within a year, as required by law. The Supreme Court upheld the government s appeal in its ruling on Monday, saying the High Court had misdirected itself. Since the birth was not registered in terms of the Citizenship Act, it was not competent for the High Court to grant the relief it did to the respondent, the court said, according to AFP. The Supreme Court further explained that the Ministry of Home Affairs was right in not granting the child citizenship by descent because there was non-compliance with the Citizenship Act. The Namibian ministry had also previously demanded a DNA test to prove that one of the child s parents was Namibian. The couple refused to undergo the test. The latest court decision has been met with disappointment by the couple, who argued that the judiciary should prioritize the best interests of the child. One of Yona s parents, Luhl, told the media that the ruling by the Supreme Court was just another way of frustrating people that don t have full access to equality, frustrating them with bureaucratic procedural matters. Homosexuality is still illegal in Namibia, although the 1927 sodomy law is rarely enforced today. South Africa has been the only African country to allow same-sex marriage since 2006.

The president made the remarks at the International Parliamentary Conference Russia Africa in a Multipolar World, which kicked off in Moscow on Monday and brought together representatives of some 40 nations. The conference comes ahead of the second Russia-Africa summit, which is scheduled to take place in St. Petersburg in July. African nations are continuously increasing their weight and role in international affairs, and are asserting themselves more and more confidently in politics and economy. We are convinced that Africa will become one of the leaders in the emerging new multipolar world order all objective prerequisites for this exist, Putin stated. Russia and African nations stand together against the neo-colonial ideology imposed by certain powers in the world, Putin went on. Many states of Asia, the Middle East, and South America stand on similar positions, and together we make up the world majority, he added. Moscow is committed to continue building a strategic partnership with Africa, while multiple Russian state-owned and private companies are already actively investing into the continent, Putin stressed. We are ready to jointly shape the global agenda, work together to strengthen fair and equal interstate relations, and improve mechanisms for mutually beneficial economic cooperation, he said, describing African nations as Russia s friends in the full sense of this word.

"20 Mar, 2023",South Africa responds to ICC warrant against Russian president,"While aware of its legal obligation, a presidential spokesperson declined to speculate on what would happen if Putin visits in August South Africa has taken note of the International Criminal Court s (ICC) arrest warrant issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a spokesperson for President Cyril Ramaphosa. The country will hold the 15th BRICS summit this August, with the heads of state from Russia, Brazil, India, and China expected to attend. As a signatory to the ICC, South Africa is obligated to carry out an arrest warrant if a person named in a court order enters the country. However, Vincent Magwenya has stated that it s too early to say what would happen should Putin visit the country. We are, as the government, cognizant of our legal obligation. However, between now and the summit we will remain engaged with various relevant stakeholders, he told the media on Sunday. In 2017, the ICC found South Africa in a breach of its obligations by failing to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he visited the country in 2015 for an African leaders summit. In 2009, the court issued a warrant for him on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity for his role in the long-running conflict in Darfur, which has killed around 300,000 people and displaced more than two million. Following the incident, South African officials applied to withdraw from the court, a decision that was later reversed after a High Court ruling determined that such a move was unconstitutional. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president and the presidential commissioner for children s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, on March 17. The court claimed that the two were complicit in the unlawful deportation of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the warrants are null and void from the legal standpoint, while the court is not recognized in Russia.

"18 Mar, 2023","The UK's new defense review reveals globe-spanning ambition, but little to back it up","British military planners are waking up to the new multipolar world, but still cling to imperialist wishful thinking ByFelix Livshitz In March 2021, the UKpublisheda comprehensive articulation of London s national security and international policy for decades to come, which would [shape] the open international order of the future, known as the Integrated Review . Its vision was amazingly bold, and foresaw the UK becoming a pre-eminent power in the Asia-Pacific, expanding its presence via overseas military bases, and increasing its nuclear weapon stockpile. There is little sign of London making even mild progress on any of its grandiose objectives two years later, But what s more, it has now published acomprehensive'refresh' of these plans, responding to a more contested and volatile world. As the new report s introduction explains, the original Integrated Review identified four trends that would shape the international environment to 2030: shifts in the distribution of global power; inter-state, systemic competition over the nature of the international order; rapid technological change; and worsening transnational challenges. The 'refresh' reflects the pace at which these trends have accelerated over the past two years, but also how the transition into a multipolar, fragmented and contested world has happened more quickly and definitively than anticipated. Changes resulting from this seismic shift mean it s necessary to update UK s priorities and core tasks to reflect the resulting changes in the global context. Thus, London s reformed Integrated Review is the first major public recognition by a Western government that Russia s military operation in Ukraine has heralded the arrival of multipolarity, and thrown the US-dominated world order, which has reigned unchallenged since the Cold War s conclusion, into chaos. Underlining this, the introduction explicitly states the collective security of the UK and NATO is now intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine. There are major problems elsewhere too. The 'refresh' notes that there has been an intensification of systemic competition in recent years, and this is now the dominant geopolitical trend and the main driver of the deteriorating security environment in the world. By deteriorating security environment, it means a global milieu in which the US is no longer the uncontested hegemon, able to dictate political and economic terms to the rest of the world, which translates to vassals in Europe and North America cannot profit to the same degree as a result. This is clear from a section lamenting the growing convergence of non-Western states that are working together to undermine the international system or remake it in their image and continues: China s deepening partnership with Russia and Russia s growing cooperation with Iran in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine are two developments of particular concern Tensions in the Indo-Pacific are increasing and conflict there could have global consequences greater than the conflict in Ukraine. However, in terms of countering these perceived threats, the new Integrated Review offers little in its 63 pages. To counter the highly complex phenomenon of systemic competition internationally, it is proposed that the UK must navigate with an understanding that not everyone s values or interests consistently align with our own. Today s international system cannot simply be reduced to democracy versus autocracy , or divided into binary, Cold War-style blocs An expanding group of middle-ground powers ...do not want to be drawn into zero-sum competition any more than the UK does, the Review records. We will need to work with these countries to protect our shared higher interest in an open and stable international order, accepting that we may not share all of the same values and national interest. In other words, the UK at long last comprehends the need to depoliticize its foreign relationships in order to maintain favorable economic ties abroad. By contrast, Beijing has long understood thatself-righteously imposingits own ideological and ethical standards on other countries is counterproductive so the Review is effectively conceding that the world s playing field is now being dictated by Beijing to a large degree, and less powerful countries are forced to adapt to this reality. China has quite a head start in this regard two decades of ever-deepening, constructive ties with virtually the entire Global South and infinitely greater wealth with which to pursue diplomatic, political and trade ties with Africa, Asia, and Latin America on the basis of mutual benefit. Whether London has the ability to effectively play catch up, and its newfound cognisance that overseas governments and publics won t be lectured to and will be viewed as sincere, remains to be seen. A similar lack of vision and solution is evident in the Review s updated Russia strategy. It notes that the Ukraine conflict has brought large-scale, high intensity land warfare back to our home region, with implications for the UK and NATO s approach to deterrence and defence, and speaks of an urgent need to contain and challenge Russia s ability and intent to disrupt the security of the UK, the Euro-Atlantic and the wider international order. Again, concrete proposals for achieving these ends are almost completely unforthcoming, but it also seems that London is in a state of denial about its lack of power to do so in any event. The Review boasts of having weakened the Russian war machine with hundreds of targeted sanctions, coordinated with our allies, and provided £2.3 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine which will be maintained by at least the same level in 2023/24. As Western journalists, think tanks, and politicians have begrudgingly begun to admit, those sanctions have fallenfar shortof achieving their goal of destroying the Russian economy. In truth, Moscow s trade, budget surplus, current account, and currency value are all at higher levels now than before the Ukraine offensive started while the countries imposing the sanctions are feeling the pain caused by them. The Review even acknowledges this inconvenient reality again, a rare if not wholly unique development for a Western government. It refers to the growing impact of global volatility on the daily lives of the British people, and the far-reaching consequences from pursuing a proxy war with Moscow rather than diplomatic settlement: [The conflict] has contributed to a huge rise in energy prices and serious burdens on families, leading to unprecedented government intervention. More widely, geopolitical instability is manifesting itself in interrupted supply chains and rising prices for basic goods. Consequently, the UK s ability to shape the global environment and to identify, address and confront threats is of growing importance to domestic policy, and to our national wellbeing. To address this, the Review simply advocates more weapons for Ukraine, and the maintenance of the sanctions. Where these arms will come from isn t clear. Government ministersadmitthat London has sent Kiev so much that it risks running out of weapons, and it will take several years for stocks to be replenished, even if there were money to do so, which there reportedly is not. Following the publication of the original Integrated Review two years ago, US State Department journal Foreign Affairs wasscathingin its assessment of London s superpower ambitions. In an article titled The Delusions of Global Britain , the magazine suggested the UK approach foreign policy with a little more humility, and reconcile itself to the role of middle power : Instead of indulging in Commonwealth or Indo-Pacific fantasies, London should seek its strengths closer to home where it can use its new status as the EU s main external partner to magnify its global influence. Clearly, that caution failed to resonate in London s halls of power, and now the UK finds itself in a transformed multipolar world. It still clings to wishful thinking, while offering no new ideas for addressing its waning significance and clout.",https://www.rt.com/news/573128-uk-defense-london-review/
"18 Mar, 2023",The battle for African hearts and minds: Here's why the West is upset about Russia's growing influence on the continent,"As France continues to lose influence, Moscow and Washington compete to take its place On Sunday, March 19, the 2nd International Parliamentary Conference 'Russia Africa' willstartin Moscow. Over 40 official delegations from all over the continent will participate in the event, with discussions ranging from Russian-African cooperation to Western neocolonialism. The forum is just one link in a long chain of recent contacts between officials in Moscow and their African counterparts that will culminate in the second Russia-Africa Summit, scheduled for July of this year in St. Petersburg. Moscowhopesthat the event will elevate its relations with the countries involved to a new level of cooperation. Based on recent meetings between Russian diplomats and their African counterparts, it is clear that the new relations will be marked not only by economic, but also military partnership. The US and its allies have expressed concern over the issue and, as the Russian Foreign Ministrywarns,have attempted to disrupt the upcoming summit. But is this something the West can achieve, considering its slackening grip on the developing world? Moscow demonstrated its serious interest in the world s fastest-growing region, Africa, at the end of the last decade. The first Russia Africa Summit, held in Sochi in 2019, gathered representatives from all 54 African countries, with 43 states being represented at the highest level. Eight major integration associations and organizations also participated. The eventcostthe Russian authorities 4.5 billion rubles ($69 million) and was one of the most expensive of its kind. However, the investments paid off a hundredfold by the end of the summit, the sidessignedcontracts worth at least 800 billion rubles ($12 billion). Following the military offensive in Ukraine and the rupture of relations between Russia and the West, contacts with the Global South have become even more valuable for Russia. This is evidenced by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov s recent activity. In the first months of 2023, he has already toured Africa twice. At the end of January, he visited several sub-Saharan countries: South Africa, Eswatini (Swaziland), Angola, and Eritrea. In February, he traveled around North Africa to Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan. Lavrov s previous large-scale tour of Africa was in July 2022 and included Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, and the Republic of the Congo. Moreover, in the first months of 2023, his deputies held meetings with the ambassadors of African states in Moscow, while Russian ambassadors to African countries met with local authorities. In addition to discussions of the forthcoming Russia Africa Summit, Lavrov s recent encounters with African representatives focused on cooperation on food and energy security and military partnership. In South Africa, the minister discussed joint trilateral naval exercises with China, whichtook placein the Indian Ocean from February 17 to 27. For these exercises, a Russian Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate crossed the Atlantic. In Angola, Lavrovrecalledthe successful launch of the Angosat-2 satellite by Roscosmos in October 2022. He assured the authorities of further high-tech cooperation, expressed happiness at the growing interest in the Russian language, and spoke about creating common currencies within the framework of institutions like BRICS. In Eritrea, Lavrovstatedthat Moscow is ready to meet the country s needs in the matter of maintaining defense capabilities and developing military-technical cooperation. In Mali, the Russian Ministerdiscussedthe joint fight against terrorism in the Sahel-Saharan zone, the education of Malian students through the Russian Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the ongoing supply of weapons and military equipment. In Mauritania, the partiesdiscussedRussian tech transfers and cooperation in healthcare, including training Mauritanian students at Russian medical universities and the work of Russian doctors in the country. With Sudanese leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, a preliminary agreement wasmaderegarding the construction of a Russian naval base on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. These events received broadcoveragein Western media and apparently became a source of concern for the bloc's politicians. Soon afterwards, the West embarked on its own series of contacts with African countries. In December 2022, at a press conference on the eve of a US-Africa Summit forum, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austinclaimedthat the growing influence of Russia and China in Africa could destabilize the region. Backing loud statements with action, the United Statespromisedto allocate $55 billion to African countries. Indeed, at the beginning of 2023, the United Statesconductedjoint military exercises with 32 African countries in the Atlantic Ocean. There were alsoreportsof US plans for a military base in Morocco, which would be used to limit the influence of Russia and China in Africa. In March, the United States openly called on African countries to limit partnership with Russia, tying this to the conflict in Ukraine. Our goal, frankly, is to make very clear to these countries, from an economic standpoint, that your economic interests are aligned with Russia s invasion of Ukraine ending as soon as possible, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemosaid. In March, Adeyemo is scheduled to pay an official visit to Ghana, Nigeria, and one other African country. In her turn, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen already traveled to Senegal, Zambia, and South Africa in January. Washington's contacts with Africa are not limited to officials from the Department of Treasury. In February, First Lady Jill Biden herself paid a diplomaticvisitto Namibia and Kenya. The series of US visits is scheduled to continue with the trip of Vice President Kamala Harris, who will visit Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia from March 25 to April 2. According tothe Special Representative of the President of Russia for the Middle East and Africa, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, the United States and its allies are waging an unprecedented campaign to politically and economically isolate Russia, and also disrupt the second Russia-Africa Summit in St. Petersburg this July. Incidentally, Bogdanov mentioned not just the US, but also its partners since another country has been very active (even if less successfully) in Africa lately France. In early March, French President Emmanuel Macron visited four Central African states during a week-long tour: Gabon, Angola, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). During the trip, hestatedthat the Françafrique era, during which Paris exercised an informal guardianship over its former colonies, is now over and has given way to a new harmonious partnership. According to Macron, this new partnership implies a noticeable reduction of French military personnel in Africa, the reorganization of military bases, and a new model of military cooperation. However, these statements look a lot more like the inevitable acceptance of reality than a gesture of free will. In recent years, Paris has decided to withdraw troops from the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali, and Burkina Faso. The decision was preceded not only by mass anti-French demonstrations by the local population, but also by Russia s growing ties with these states. The most striking example of French failure is the Central African Republic. France took home its troops only in December last year. For many years, Paris used various means, including military, to intervene in the country s national politics by supporting or removing its presidents. When in 2012, civil war broke out between the government and insurgents, peacekeepers from France and other EU countries unsuccessfully tried to end the conflict. In 2018, CAR authorities turned to Russia for help andsignedan agreement on military cooperation. Moscow supplied the republic with ammunition, trained the local military, and gradually increased the number of military instructors in the country. Less than a year after Russia intervened, the authorities managed to negotiate a truce with several local groups. CAR authorities later expressedgratitudeto Russia for its role in the peacemaking process. The success of Russian weapons and diplomacy was converted into economic benefits. In 2020, Russian companies were givenpermissionto mine gold and diamonds in the Central African Republic. Not long ago, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central African Republic, Sylvie Baipo-Temon, openlystatedthat the mistakes of France had cleared the path for Russia. Events in Mali played out in a similar manner. At the request of the local authorities, French troops had been fighting Muslim insurgents since 2013. But the situation only got worse over time. Finally, the leaders of the military juntarequestedRussian assistance in fighting the insurgents associated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. As a result, Russian military instructors trained the local army and helped fight the militants. In general, France is losing its military and diplomatic presence in Africa. Maliexpelledthe French ambassador in early 2022, and by August, French troops werewithdrawnto neighboring Niger. In September 2022, a military coup occurred in Burkina Faso, and in January the new government demanded French troops leave the country. Thousands of demonstratorsgatheredin Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, to support the new government just several days after Paris confirmed the withdrawal of its troops from the country. The protesters reportedly carried the flags of Burkina Faso and Russia. The newspaper Vzglyadreportsthat the coup in Burkina Faso resulted in Niger s first officially authorized protest in fifty years. The demonstrators shouted the slogans,""France out!""and""Long live Putin and Russia!"" The French publication Le Point put a tellingheadlineon its article summarizing the events in Africa: France shown out the door, a red carpet spread before Russia. The article notes that the situation was caused by public skepticism regarding the ability and willingness of the French troops to protect the people in Mali and Burkina Faso. According to French media sources, only 2,000 French military remained in Niger, 500 in Senegal, and another 900 on the Côte d'Ivoire. During his speech in Benin immediately after Lavrov's summer tour of Africa, Macronattemptedto throw shade at Moscow by labeling it one of the last imperial colonial powers. The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, echoed him andvoicedconcerns about the demonstrations in Mali. I saw on TV these young African people walking the streets of Bamako with posters saying ‘Putin, thank you! You saved Donbass and now you will save us! . It s shocking, he said. Former US Special Envoy J. Peter Phamtoldthe FT that the collective West has lost its influence in certain African countries due to its unwillingness to cooperate in the military-technical field. In particular, he noted that the US State Department vetoed the sale of an Airbus transport aircraft equipped with an American-made transponder to Mali. The Malian Ministry of Foreign Affairs thus agreed to receive both equipment and military aid from Moscow. According toThe Times, the US and the former powers Britain and France have been losing their grip on Africa, while Moscow and Beijing are expanding their presence in the region. ""Russia's growing influence highlights the evolving relationships on the world's fastest-growing continent [Africa], the newspaper reports. The authors claim that Moscow can count on Africa, which has long been the playground of the great world powers, to support it at the global level and particularly at the UN. The Times added that the goal of the US Africa Summit was to lure African leaders into joining the Western side. But the renewed fight for Africa may already be lost considering the expanding presence of Russia and China in the region. Incidentally, compared to the West, Russia is a lot more restrained in assessing its prospects in Africa. A number of experts believe that Moscow s increasing military presence there is not a solid enough foundation for successful Russian-African relations. Anthropologist and host of the Telegram channel African Behemoth Artyom Rykov notes that in order to secure its influence and gain new allies on the continent, Russia needs more than just a military presence. It needs to establish large-scale joint cultural and economic projects with African countries, which, as of now, do not exist. It s about informal ties. For example, understanding where local elites spend their free time and where they educate their children. It s also about trade finding a market for our goods in an African country. It s also important to understand what kind of goods we re talking about, Rykov said. Grigory Lukyanov, a researcher at the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), is also confident about establishing cooperation between Russia and Africa in various fields in order to build partnerships. He believes that bilateral relations are currently in need of specific economic projects and a more systematic approach. According to Lukyanov, Africa's current sympathy for Russia is mainly rooted in anti-Western sentiments. The anti-French, anti-British, anti-colonial agenda is once again dominant in Africa. It has gained supporters who are ready, able, and willing to loudly discuss it and receive major political benefits from it. But does this really mean that the region has become more pro-Russian? Lukyanov wonders. The researcher believes that pro-Russian views based on anti-American, anti-European, anti-French, and anti-British sentiments cannot be considered a stable model. The absence of a constructive agenda will soon become apparent. If France or the United States leave a particular country, the pro-Russian views will lose their foundation. If you can't hate someone together, why should you be friends? Why should you love or at least tolerate and understand each other? he says. Artyom Rykov believes that Western media and politicians are aware of this and discuss the threat posed by Russia in a preventive sort of manner. In reality, he notes, we cannot say that Russia has come to replace the West in Africa. Representatives of the African elite aren t quick to express such views either. In an interview with RT France, in response to the question Does Burkina Faso want Russia to replace France? the Prime Minister said, Our goal is to have more opportunities. It s not to have someone replace somebody else. It s also worth noting that most African countries refrain from publicly taking sides in the conflict between Russia and the West. This is the true reason (and not Africa s alleged sympathy toward Russia) why the region does not support anti-Russian sanctions, as noted by the Washington Post back in December. However, Lukyanov says, Russia does not need to win the favor of African countries. Russia needs partnerships with African countries. He believes that Russia and Africa need mutually beneficial relations not in order to extract resources or win votes in the UN, but to establish partnerships within a new and just world order one that would replace the current crisis. Lukyanov is confident that the course of events in Russia, Africa, and the world both in the coming decade and in the 21st century in general will depend on effectively achieving this task. According to many experts, we currently stand at the beginning of a long journey and may only anticipate the results of Russia's activities in Africa. As Lukyanov emphasizes, a lot of work is still necessary especially in the quad aspects of church, society, state, and business before we are able to discuss major results in the long term.

"18 Mar, 2023",NATO bombed Libya to protect civilians 12 years ago. This led to thousands of deaths and a country in ruins,"The Western war machine only served its own interests in destroying a nation that could liberate Africa ByMoussa Ibrahim, spokesperson of the Libyan Government and Minister of Media, 2011 ByMoussa Ibrahim, spokesperson of the Libyan Government and Minister of Media, 2011 On the 19th of March 2011, the NATO bloc began a violent 8-month long military onslaught of Libya, a sovereign African-Union founding member state, which had enjoyed four decades of stability, prosperity and one of the highest Human Development Index (HDI) scores in all of Africa. NATO s justification for the aggressive and bloody attack was the now-infamous protection of civilians'' doctrine, formalized under UN Security Council Decree No. 1973. The French Air Force, however, had already initiated a major raid on immobile Libyan Army units. They had already pulled out of the city of Benghazi, a protest hotbed, in a show of goodwill and peaceful intent. More than 400 resting Libyan officers, soldiers, medical and media personnel were massacred without the chance to fight back against an unjustified and undeclared foreign air attack. Tens of thousands more Libyans would later perish under more than 26,000 air raids, 100 cruise missile attacks and a naval blockade conducted by NATO s 30-member coalition. Among the victims were a terrifying number of civilians from all walks of life. The number of women and children killed was especially high, as they sought refuge in civilian buildings deliberately targeted by the mighty NATO: including houses, apartment blocks, schools and community centers. As we witnessed time and time again in Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan and Syria, NATO justified these attacks by claiming they were seeking out fighters and weaponry housed in civilian facilities. No evidence has ever been presented. In the weeks that led up to this aggression, I spoke officially for the Libyan Government in countless international press conferences, media appearances and diplomatic appeals. Before hundreds of international media outlets, I expressed one single demand: that all hostilities cease under the direct supervision of the UN and that the African Union installs an international fact-finding mission to determine who committed what act, paving the way for a national conference of all Libyan parties to the conflict. This single most powerful and earnest appeal was rejected without consideration in Western centers of hegemony and ridiculed in Western media outlets. The only solutions that were endorsed and praised were more rockets, bombs and the continuous arming of Islamist and tribalist terrorist groups on the ground. In the years after, crimes against humanity charges against the revolutionary government of Libya were either never proven or were shown to have been false. In fact, given its 12 years of total control over Libya (land, resources, institutions and archives), the West has been unable to show the alleged 8,000victims of rapeby the Libyan army, nor the 10,000 murdered civilians, nor the neighbourhoods of Tripoli allegedly destroyed by Muammar Gaddafi s air force, nor the African mercenaries supposedly imported by the Gaddafi government in the first week of the Libyan Spring (15-22 February 2011). The actual crimes of the Libyan revolutionary Government, however, were real and consequential: Gaddafi s Libya was re-shaping the political, economic and cultural context of the African continent in radical and independent ways not seen since the nominal de-colonization of African countries in the 1950s and 1960s. On September 9, 1999, under the leadership of Gaddafi, the establishment of the African Union was announced in his birthplace, the coastal city of Sirte (the very city in which he would fight his last battle against NATO in 2011). Gaddafi then announced the start of a major revolutionary project for the plundered and exploited continent: building pan-African economic, security and communication institutions with the aim of gaining complete and true independence from the control of the West. The most consequential of these institutions were the African Central Bank (ACB), the African Golden Dinar, the African Gold Reserve, the African Security Council (ASC), the Unified African Army (UAA), the African Parliament, the African Organisation for Natural Resources (AONR), the African Communications Network (ACN) and the African Common Market. Indeed, Gaddafi led the way towards the establishment of some of those institutions, initiated the build-up of the Libyan gold reserve and was on the threshold of issuing the African Golden Dinar, which he considered naming the Afro. These real on-the-ground projects would have liberated the continent from the dominance of Western centers of power and monopoly, transforming global economic structures and inspiring other regions in the Global South to unite, organize and fight . The Europeans and Americans did warn Gaddafi against his meddling in Africa. The US, under an African-American president, hurried to create AfriCom, the American pan-African military force, in 2008. The French followed suit with their deployment of an anti-terrorism task force in the Sahel. Moreover, the intensity with which the continent s riches were stolen increased (especially gold) while the meddling of British, French and American diplomats in the affairs of the African Union and African Parliament also grew exponentially. The focus of Western mainstream media in the 2000s on a new and collaborative spirit in economic relations with Africa was therefore not accidental it was all as planned and in harmony with the military, economic and political agenda in Western centers of power. Then, in 2011, utilizing the political turmoil in Tunisia and Egypt, the West encouraged and ordered its agents on the ground in Libya to foment a false revolution in small pockets inside the country. This was spearheaded by the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an infamous Afghani-Libyan terrorist organization with training and weaponry from the American army and battlefield commanders trained and exalted by NATO s top educational personnel in the caves of Afghanistan in the 1980s and early 1990s. The West promised the world democracy, human rights, and prosperity for Libya and the whole Sahel and Sahara region in Africa. Instead, by the 12th anniversary of the NATO onslaught, Libya itself had become a notorious slave market for illegally imported African migrants and a battlefield for French-orchestrated African Sahel tribalist conflicts (in Chad, Niger, Mali). The country that once led Africa s liberation project now lies in ruins, with 10 foreign-controlled military bases scattered across its territory, hosting more than 20,000 foreign troops and mercenaries, and bearing$576 billion in financial lossessince the start of NATO s intervention. Over 60,000 additional Libyans have been killed in the ongoing civil conflict, fuelled and maintained by mostly foreign and Western-sponsored forces fighting for their interests and dominance on the Libyan front. All sectors of the Libyan economy and society (education, health, housing, employment and living standards) have been devastated, dismantled and ravaged by 12 years of Western-funded conflict and political turmoil. As for Africa as a whole, the great African Union has lost its edge after a total freeze on most of the aforementioned projects of liberation, from the African Golden Dinar to the Unified African Army. In fact, the West s exploitative economic, political and military presence in Africa has only increased since the murder of Gaddafi, a true testimony to the very reason he was assassinated. In the last few weeks, the UN Security Council has appointed the 8th Special Representative to Libya since 2011, Mr. Abdoulaye Bathily. Mr. Bathily has been conducting the same routine visits to the warlords and their militias in Libya, holding the same routine political and press conferences and reiterating the same old Security Council discourse: we are here to bring democracy and prosperity to all Libyans, and we shall defend human rights and protect civilians. Those who oppose this political process will be brought before international justice. The only problem is that Mr. Bathily is speaking as if this is the first day of the first year of the Libyan tragedy. He does not bother to mention that it is instead the 12th Anniversary of the devastation of a developed, prosperous and stable African nation. Furthermore, he doesn t bother to highlight the simple fact that foreign military powers and mercenaries are present and active in Libya, something at least acknowledged by his predecessor, Stephanie Williams. However, there is always hope for the great black continent. The legacy of its great leaders and martyrs from Gamal Nasser to Patrice Lumumba to Kwame Nkrumah to Nelson Mandela continues to inspire African consciousness, struggle and resistance. In the last few months, for example, a major popular movement has been building up in Western Africa to end all Western military presence in the Sahel region, with governments starting to slowly but steadily heed these calls for liberation and sovereignty. Wherever you go in Africa nowadays, you can hear the literal words and viable ideas of Gaddafi coming up in conversations about African liberty, independence and dignity. In my work with the Libyan Green Resistance and the African popular movements, I am always faced by this question raised by thousands of African freedom fighters: what to do? My answer is always straight and simple to all my African comrades: unite, organize and fight!",https://www.rt.com/africa/573132-nato-bombed-libya-africa/
"16 Mar, 2023",Biden recalls gay epiphany ,"The US president claimed that a high school incident opened his mind to same-sex marriage, but his voting record suggests otherwise US President Joe Biden claimed this week that seeing two men kiss while he was in high school led him to support gay marriage. However, Biden was a staunch opponent of same-sex unions until he was in his 60s. Speaking to The Daily Show host Kal Penn on Monday, Biden said that he had an epiphany on the issue when his father dropped him off at high school during his senior year. I [was] about to get out of the car and I look to my right and two well-dressed men in suits kissed each other, leaned in and gave each other a kiss, he said. I ll never forget it. I turned and looked at my dad and he said, Joey, it s simple. They love each other . It doesn t matter whether it s same sex or a heterosexual couple, they should be able to get married, Biden then declared. Biden: I can remember exactly when my epiphany [on supporting gay marriage] was ... I was a senior in high school. And my dad was dropping me off and I remember I was about to get out of the car and I looked to my right and two well-dressed men in suits kissed each other.""pic.twitter.com/0aHlUQ7ghJ Biden graduated from the Archmere Academy, a private Catholic school in Claymont, Delaware, in 1961. When he entered politics a decade later, hetolda gay activist that homosexuals are security risks, and should therefore be barred from military service. As a senator, Biden went on to vote for a 1994amendmentthat would strip federal funding from any school district that teaches acceptance of homosexuality as a lifestyle, and the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. When President George W. Bush sought to add this definition to the US Constitution in 2006, Biden opposed the measure. He did not argue that his views had changed, but that as Congress had already made heterosexual marriage the law of the land, Bush s proposal was a waste of time. We all voted on it, Biden told NBC News at the time. Marriage is between a man and a woman and states must respect that. Biden eventually changed his stance in 2012, when his boss, President Barack Obama, came out in favor of same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court ruled the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional a year later, and the law was fully repealed when Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act last year. Throughout his political career, Biden has been known to fabricate stories of his past. Hefalsely claimedto have been arrested en route to meeting Nelson Mandela in prison in Apartheid-era South Africa, and that he was arrested while protesting for civil rights in the 1960s. He has told several versions of his epiphany tale before too,claimingin 2014 that he played the role of the father in the story, andrecallinga year later that the supposed incident took place when his father was driving him to apply for jobs in Wilmington, Delaware, as a 17-year-old.

"16 Mar, 2023",Cocaine production at record levels UN,"Traffickers have devised new methods to distribute stockpiles of the drug, a UN Office on Drugs and Crime report says Production of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has risen by 35% compared to pre-pandemic levels, as drug cartels take advantage of receding Covid-19 restrictions to smuggle record amounts of the narcotic across the world, according to a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The spike in cocaine production is the sharpest rise since 2016 and comes amid efforts by powerful South American drug cartels to streamline the efficiency of drug labs. The pandemic was a bit of a blip for the expansion of cocaine production, noted UNODC researcher Antoine Vella in comments published by The Guardian. He added that it has since rebounded to levels higher than before Covid-19. Demand dropped in recent years due to the closure of many bars and nightclubs during lockdowns, the report explains. The findings suggest that cartels were forced to devise alternative methods to distribute the drug during the pandemic after many international flights were grounded and road traffic was heavily policed, forcing them to stockpile the drug. Various drug seizures showed that traffickers had attempted to disguise cocaine in the distribution of everyday items such as inside avocados and even surgical facemasks. One case, officials said, even saw traffickers break the substance down into fabrics to bypass authorities before being reconstituted at its eventual destination. The report adds that UK officials have noted a significant increase in the seizure of cocaine delivered via international postal systems as well as through courier services. There s no question that there is no limit to the ingenuity of traffickers, Vella said, as they look to maintain supply to Europe and North America, regions responsible jointly for three-quarters of global cocaine consumption. Cartels have also established new routes to traffic and to distribute the drug as they look to avoid scrutiny from anti-narcotics agents, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa, the report said. Ports such as Rotterdam, Antwerp and Hamburg have risen in prominence for the importation of the narcotic, compared to traditional entry points into Europe in Spain and Portugal. The global demand for the drug has also led to increased coca cultivation and production in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia where, in the latter, the amount of land used to produce coca bushes rose by 40% in 2021 to a total of 204,000 hectares.

The ministry said the three-nation Security Bond-2023 wargames in the Gulf of Oman run from March 15 to 19, and that several unspecified countries will also be joining. This exercise will help deepen the practical cooperation between the navies of the participating countries, further demonstrate the willingness and ability to jointly maintain maritime security, the ministry stated, adding that it will inject positive energy into regional peace and stability . China s guided-missile destroyer Nanning will be taking part, the ministry said, noting that Security Bond-2023 will build on the drills held by China, Russia and Iran in 2019 and 2022. In late 2019, similar three-nation exercises took place in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, with a spokesman for the Iranian military, Abolfazl Shekarchi, saying the goal was to counter terrorism and piracy. In 2022, the Security Bond maneuvers encompassed the northern part of the Indian Ocean and involved the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite branch of Tehran s military. Earlier this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said cooperation between Moscow and Beijing had reached a whole new level, with the partnership serving as one of the main deterrents to the aggressive activities of the United States and its henchmen in the Asia-Pacific region. In late February, China conducted another naval drill with Russia, along with South Africa. While Pretoria called it a means of increasing coordination between the three countries, Western media branded the move controversial in view of the Ukraine conflict. The US also weighed in, with the White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre stating in January that Washington has concerns about any country exercising with Russia as Moscow continues its military campaign in Ukraine.

"9 Mar, 2023",US to discourage African nations from doing business with Russia official,"The deputy treasury secretary will attempt to pressure several states to toe the line on Ukraine US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo is planning a trip to Africa, where he will press officials in Ghana, Nigeria, and another unnamed country to cut their business ties with Russia, he said on Wednesday. Speaking to Pod Save the World host Ben Rhodes, Adeyemo said that the trip would take place this month. The goal, he explained, is to convince his host countries that the worldwide spike in food and energy prices is Russia's fault, even though US President Joe Biden has admitted that Washington s sanctions on Russia have raised costs in an awful lot of countries. Our goal is to make very clear to [these] countries from an economic standpoint: your economic interests are aligned with Russia s invasion of Ukraine ending as soon as possible, Adeyemo said. The US is trying to do everything we can to reduce the costs [that Africa is] facing due to this war, he claimed, adding that Africans should be asking Russia to do the same. Ghana and Nigeria, like many other African nations, rely heavily on grain and fertilizer imports from Ukraine and Russia. Although Russia and Ukraine signed a deal last August to establish a safe corridor to transport grain from Ukrainian ports to countries facing food insecurity, Moscowwarnedearlier this month that EU nations and other upper-middle income countries are receiving 81% of the grain from Ukraine, with only 2.6% going to the countries that need it the most. Meanwhile, Western sanctions are impeding the delivery of Russian grain by sea. Kiev also continues to block a vital ammonia pipeline, causing a shortage of the compound that could be used to produce seven million tons of fertilizer, the Russian Foreign Ministry stated. Adeyemo said that the US does not want African nations to trade with Russia. They can support Russia, which is a small economy that s getting smaller because of our actions, or [they] can continue to have access to doing business with companies and individuals in countries that represent more than 50% of the global economy, he told Rhodes. While both Ghana and Nigeria voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia s military operation in Ukraine, neither have imposed sanctions on Moscow. The majority of UN members have taken a similar position, which the US Treasury has worked to change. During a visit to Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman last month, Brian Nelson, the department s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, warned that these countries could lose access to Western markets if they continued to trade with sanctioned Russian entities.

Aliko Dangote, the founder and chairman of the continent s largest cement producer, Dangote Cement, leads the ranking, remaining Africa s richest businessman for the twelfth year in a row. His fortune is estimated to be $19.4 billion, the index showed. South African businessman Johann Rupert was ranked second, with a net worth of $12.1 billion. Rupert is the chairman of Swiss luxury goods firm Richemont, whose brand portfolio includes brands such as Cartier, Montblanc, Chloe, Dunhill, and Van Cleef & Arpels. Since the beginning of the year, his fortune has surged by $1.19 billion, largely thanks to growth in his stake in Richemont, the data showed. Nicky Oppenheimer, another South African and heir to the De Beers diamond fortune, is the third richest man on the African continent. He has earned $425 million since the beginning of the year, increasing his fortune to $8.5 billion.

"6 Mar, 2023",Former Russian president eyes final nail in neocolonialism s coffin,"Truly sovereign states are no longer afraid of Western diktat, Dmitry Medvedev says Russia is ready to help the world do away with the vestiges of a Western-dominated colonial past, former president Dmitry Medvedev has claimed. The official argued that as a nation which has never had any colonies, Russia is well-placed to take part in this process. In an article published on Monday, Medvedev claimed that geopolitical turbulence has cut open an abscess of the old problems of our world. The ex-president and now deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, argued that the malignant tumor of a colonial past is a problem that calls for international surgery. He noted that the Soviet Union played a major role in dismantling the colonial system of the 20th century. We, together with other countries, can now drive the final nail in the coffin of the Western world s neo-colonial aspirations, Medvedev proclaimed in the piece, posted on the United Russia party website. As an example, the former president cited Argentina s decision to renounce a 2016 deal with the UK with respect to the disputed Falkland/Malvinas islands in the South Atlantic, which were at the center of a military conflict in 1982. On Thursday, Argentinian Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero said he had notified his British counterpart, James Cleverly, of the move during a meeting in New Delhi, India, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Buenos Aires has proposed to resume negotiations on the question of sovereignty in compliance with the mandate of the UN General Assembly and the world body s Committee on Decolonization, Cafiero clarified. Medvedev argued that the decisions to show French troops the door last year by two of France's former colonies in Africa, the Central African Republic and Mali, fit this pattern too. Medvedev pointed out, however, that there are still a number of dependent territories around the globe ruled by Western powers such as the UK and France. He expressed skepticism that those nations will willingly relinquish control of the remains of their former empires. As more and more countries stop fearing Western diktat and start to assert their national interests more actively, the former colonial powers are bound to lose their hold on the regions they once thought were theirs, he concluded. Following the start of Russia s military campaign against Ukraine last February and amid fierce confrontation with the West, top Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have increasingly advocated the establishment of a multipolar world which does not center around the wishes of one single superpower.

The official noted that several Russian companies are already operating in Sudan and said that Khartoum is negotiating more investment in its energy sector with Rosneft and Zarubezhneft. Abdallah described Russia as a state with great technological capabilities and explained that as Sudan seeks to increase domestic oil production, it wants Moscow to help develop the necessary infrastructure. Upon separating from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan gained 75% of national oil fields. However, the entire infrastructure needed for oil exports remained in Sudan. Since the secession, oil production in both countries has declined due to continued political instability. Khartoum has failed to increase its crude output in recent years and is now capable of producing just 40,000-50,000 barrels per day, which is not sufficient for domestic consumption, Abdallah explained. We are keen to modernize [oil fields] and boost domestic oil production in order to reach self-sufficiency and cut reliance on crude imports from South Sudan, he noted, adding that the country is also keen to become a regional crude exporter. Earlier, the head of the Russian Energy Ministry s International Cooperation Department, Dmitry Semyonov, said that the two countries were looking into opportunities to expand cooperation in the oil sector beyond production. Russia is ready to share technology with Sudan in various areas, including oil recovery, the utilization of associate gas, oil refining, and petrochemicals production, Semyonov added.

"1 Mar, 2023",South African unemployment rate drops to two-year low,"The figure has decreased for four consecutive quarters The official unemployment rate in South Africa dropped for the fourth consecutive quarter in October-December, according to a national statistics report on Tuesday. Data showed the jobless rate slid to 32.7% in the final three months of 2022 from 32.9% in the July-September period. The figure is the lowest since the first quarter of 2021. The improvement was mainly driven by the finance sector, particularly among labor brokers and the security industry, Bloomberg cited the chief director of labor statistics, Desiree Manamela, as saying. That boost was reportedly followed by private households and the trade industry. The total number of unemployed, however, rose to 7.753 million people in October-December from 7.725 million in the previous three months. According to an expanded definition of unemployment that includes those discouraged from seeking a job, 42.6% were without work in the fourth quarter compared with 43.1% in the third. The continent s most industrialized economy, South Africa has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, which had exceeded 20% for at least two decades.

The Ugandan government delegation arrived in Pretoria to negotiate potential moves towards raising reciprocal investment and increasing the levels of trade between the two nations. Talking to journalists ahead of the meeting, the leaders highlighted the importance of intracontinental trade, while outlining the challenges African countries face in their attempts to boost trade ties. Bringing steel products from China, India and Ukraine, in the past, is very expensive, the freight alone is bigger than even the cost of the product itself, Museveni said, as cited by Africanews. So it is very important that we develop an inland steel industry for Uganda and those areas around there. We need coal from South Africa. According to Ramaphosa, developing relationships between major South African food producers and Ugandan suppliers of such products as vanilla, coffee and cocoa may help to expand the broader consumer goods market. South Africa is open to increasing the quantity and diversity of products we source from Uganda, because the success of intra-Africa trade hinges on each of us sourcing from one another and prioritizing made and grown in Africa products and services, Ramaphosa said. He added that South African companies are ready to invest more in the banking, retail, and telecommunication sectors in Uganda. The number of South African businesses in Uganda has declined from 70 firms to just 36, according to Ramaphosa, while trade volumes between the nations have recently been dropping.

"1 Mar, 2023",G20 foreign ministers meeting likely to end in deadlock with the body s relevance under threat,"Representatives of the world s 20 largest economies are meeting in India amid discord over Ukraine and US-China tensions ByJoydeep Sen Gupta, Asia Editor The G20 is in the throes of global dissonance ahead of a meeting of its member's foreign ministers in New Delhi this week. India holds its rotating presidency until November 30, 2023. The two-day event, which starts on Wednesday evening with a gala dinner, is an early gathering in the run-up to the heads of state summit that will be held in the same city in September. Representatives of the world s 20 largest economies (including the 27-member European Union) are expected to attend the event. Besides, nine nations are special invitees, who are not members of the grouping, apart from 13 international organizations, said Vinay Mohan Kwatra, India s foreign secretary during a media briefing on Wednesday morning. An early jarring note was struck by Japan, whose foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi will not attend the meeting, Kwatra confirmed. The top Indian diplomat cited the minister s domestic compulsions — he has chosen to take part in parliamentary business back home — despite New Delhi s sterling relationship with Tokyo. But Hayashi s decision should not be seen as a snub to New Delhi. Instead, it can be interpreted as a worrying sign that the G20 itself, for all its economic clout, is seen as insignificant in the current global political climate. With winds of change sweeping the world since the start of Russia s special military operation in Ukraine over a year ago, and the Kremlin s spokesman stating that NATO isde facto at warwith Russia, what can the meeting hope to achieve? G20 members represent around 85% of global gross domestic product (GDP), over 75% of global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population. Among them are many emerging economies, such as India, which are happy to take a middle path and don t want to be fully aligned with either the US-led Western nations or the Russia-China axis. The combined economic might of eight of the nine (Russia excluded) G20 members that are emerging economies India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Argentina and South Africa amounts to more than $9.5 trillion. Cumulatively, the size of their economies is larger than any single member s except the US ($23.32 trillion) and China ($18.32 trillion). Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi s slogan,Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a Sanskrit text from the Vedic scripture of theMaha Upanishad, loosely translates to One Earth, One Family, One Future. This optimistic outlook is somewhat pale amid the prevailing global situation. New Delhi has to play host to guests from opposing global camps, such as the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, together with his Western counterparts, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The gathering is bound to be a tense affair amid a growing schism among G20 members over the Ukraine conflict and the escalating US-China tensions over Taiwan as well as Washington s attempts to cut Beijing off from technical and economic development. India, as the current president, is likely to try and steer the discussion towards more neutral and global issues, such as climate change and the debt burden suffered by the world s poorest countries. On the former, Indian Minister for External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in January that a Green Development Pact would be one of the main items on the G20 agenda under India s presidency. On the latter, Modi made developing countries growing debt one of the main talking points during last month s Voice of Global South Summit. According todatareleased by the World Bank last year, $13.1 billion or about 37% of the $35 billion in debt service payments due from the world s 74 lowest-income nations during the year is owed to Chinese entities. A similar amount, $13.4 billion, is owed to the Chinese private sector. To make matters worse, the $35 billion estimate for last year was a 45% increase over the total debt payments ultimately owed in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the bank. The lack of transparency in Chinese debt holdings has been a source ofglobal debate. India is eager to play a leading role in the Global South, and speaking out against debt burden has been one of its main avenues for doing so. This issue itself could be a source of discord at the G20 gatherings even as New Delhi tries to steer discussion away from more immediately contentious subjects. Kwatra refused to speculate on the possible outcome of the meeting and on whether the Ukraine crisis would be the overarching topic of discussions. He parried the media s searching questions about which side India would lean on and deflected on terminology whether New Delhi would like to call it a conflict, war, military aggression or special military operation. He did, however, refer to Modi s remark that""today s era is not one of war , made by the PM in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, last September during the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. He also listed out the agenda for Thursday s meeting, which are divided into two distinct sessions to be presided over by Jaishankar. The first session would deliberate on the three principles of multilateral issues such as food, fertilizer and energy security coupled with developmental cooperation. The second session will center on new and emerging threats such as countering terrorism, including lethal use of narcotics, global skill mapping and humanitarian assistance and disaster risk reduction. India, which has been a beneficiary of cheap Russian crude oil since the imposition of Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, is keen to ensure that Moscow s military operation doesn t dominate the event. The topic will still almost certainly be the case, with Blinken planning to highlight US efforts to address food and energy security issues affecting developing nations. He is planning to underscore the damage that Russia's war of aggression has caused and urge other nations to press Moscow for cessation of hostilities in Ukraine , according to Ramin Toloui, the US assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs. The other big global stand-off between the US and China will most likely feature prominently as well. Recently, Beijing has been seeing red over Washington s attempt to endanger peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait after a US military aircraft flew over the contentious waterway. Previously, the Chinese Foreign Ministry had issued a rarestraightforward rebuketo American hegemony in a scathing essay widely shared by Chinese media. And earlier this month, a row erupted when the US military shot down what it claimed to be a Chinese spy balloon that flew over its airspace. Though China maintained it was a civilian research vessel that was accidentally blown off course, the dispute led to Blinken calling off his scheduled trip to Beijing. State Councilor Wang Yi called the US handling of the balloon incident unimaginable and hysterical . These factors make it likely that Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who is on his maiden trip to India after his predecessor Wang was elevated as the State Councilor, will try to counteract Blinken s anti-Russian overtures at the G20 meeting. In a zero-sum game that has come to signify modern-day diplomacy, a lack of consensus is the most plausible outcome after the two-day meeting, as Russia and China refuse to back down to bullying from US-led Western nations over the Ukraine situation. The emerging economies will likely be reduced to playing the role of a casual bystander, even as New Delhi bids to amplify its stance as the leading voice of the Global South. The G20 finance ministers meeting last Saturday failed to adopt a joint statement on the global economy over lack of consensus on a raft of issues. A similar outcome is on the cards in this week s meeting. ",https://www.rt.com/india/572217-g20-india-russia-china-us/
"27 Feb, 2023",Musk condemns racist media,"The billionaire made the comments in response to reports of the Dilbert comic being dropped by newspapers Elon Musk has accused the media en masse, as well as elite colleges and high schools, of being racist against white and Asian people. The CEO of Twitter, SpaceX and Tesla was commenting on US newspapers severing ties with the author of an award-winning comic strip for making remarks construed as racist on his personal YouTube channel. The media is racist, wrote Musk to his near 130 million Twitter followers in a response to tweets about Scott Adams, creator of the Dilbert comic strip. Adams, who in 1989 created the award-winning strip which lampooned US corporate culture, was dropped by major publishers including the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and USA Today this week after he referred to black American respondents to a poll as a hate group . He was referring to the 26% of black Americans who rejected the phrase It s OK to be white in a Rasmussen Reports poll. The term has been defined by the Anti-Defamation League as a hate slogan which originated in right-wing circles as a means of undermining various social justice movements in the US. For a *very* long time, US media was racist against non-white people, now they re racist against whites & Asians, Musk wrote. Same thing happened with elite colleges & high schools in America. Maybe they can try not being racist. Musk added in a response to a subsequent tweet, which purported to highlight a difference in reporting standards between white and black victims of police violence, that it was very disproportionate to promote a false narrative. The billionaire, who bought Twitter last year, has become an increasingly divisive figure in recent months, particularly on socio-political issues. He drew flak for ending Twitter suspensions of controversial accounts, such as those operated by satirical outlet The Babylon Bee, as well as those of former US president Donald Trump and right-wing Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. However, his authority in discussing racial issues has been questioned by civil rights attorney Brian Levin, who noted that a white billionaire from South Africa who recently lost a high profile racial discrimination case may not be in the best position to offer counsel. Musk's Tesla has been sued on several occasions for alleged racial discrimination. A federal court in San Francisco last year ruled that Tesla must pay former employee Owen Diaz damages after it found him to have suffered anti-black racist abuse while working at the company.

"27 Feb, 2023",Russia no longer at mercy of global elite Lavrov,"Moscow will determine its own external conditions for development, the diplomat said Western political leaders will no longer have the power to dictate terms to Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. Speaking with the heads of the ministry s regional offices, the diplomat stressed that Russia will now determine its own needs for development. Until recently, a couple of years ago, the external conditions that we needed for development were determined not by us, but by the Western minority, said Lavrov. He added that all the foreign policy initiatives promoted by the so-called golden billion group serve the sole purpose of making sure that the world lives by rules that allow Western elites to continue their colonial policies and live at the expense of others. Therefore, we will no longer rely on someone when it comes to creating the external conditions for the development that we need, Lavrov stressed, also pledging that Russia will not follow in the footsteps of the selfish West, and will take into account the interests of other independent states. According to the diplomat, Moscow aims to create external conditions that are as favorable as possible for the development of the country, but stressed that these conditions must also reflect the consensus of all independent states and fully comply with the principles of the UN Charter, which have been repeatedly violated by our former Western colleagues. During the meeting, Lavrov also noted that the number of countries wishing to join BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) economic blocs had increased to almost two dozen by the end of 2022. The diplomat noted that the countries wishing to join the alliances, such as Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Argentina, Mexico and several African nations, play a very prominent role in their regions. Just listing the names of these states already shows the failure of attempts [of the West] to isolate our country, Lavrov observed, adding that the opposite has happened, with independent countries now uniting with other like-minded states.

"26 Feb, 2023",Over a dozen injured in blast in Cameroon,"A bomb went off during a race in the central African country, with an Anglophone separatist group claiming responsibility An explosion during an athletics event in Cameroon has left at least 19 people injured. A separatist militia seeking independence for the central African nation s English-speaking regions said it was behind Saturday s attack. The incident took place during the Mount Cameroon Race of Hope in the town of Buea, in southwest Cameroon. Local governor Bernard Okalia Bikai told the Associated Press that nine athletes and ten civilians, including a baby, sustained injuries and have been taken to the local hospital. According to Reuters, citing unverified social media footage, there was not one, but a series of explosions along the race s route. The Ambazonia Defense Forces, one of the separatist groups fighting for the independence of English-speaking regions of the country, has claimed responsibility. It said the military were the primary target and regretted injuries to civilians. The insurgency began in 2017 in Anglophone North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon and was preceded by protests by local teachers and lawyers, who decried what they viewed as marginalization of the English-speaking minority at the hands of the Francophone national government. Cameroonian authorities, in turn, accuse the militias of perpetrating atrocities against civilians. According to UN estimates, the conflict has claimed more than 3,300 lives to date, with over 750,000 displaced. The Mount Cameroon Race of Hope is held annually, with more than 500 athletes from 13 countries taking part this year. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/572082-cameroon-race-blast-separatists/
"25 Feb, 2023",Ukraine figures high in Germany-India talks,"The German leader is on his maiden two-day visit to India to bolster ties in defense and technology ByJoydeep Sen Gupta, Asia Editor Russia s special military operation in Ukraine, which marked its first anniversary on Friday, figured high on the one-to-one talks between visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday. Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra reiterated India s position on the Ukraine situation. He emphasized that New Delhi has been concerned about the impact on food, fertilizer and fuel security, which is hurting the developing economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America collectively known as the Global South in a major way. Kwatra maintained that Germany shares concerns similar to those of India, that it's in favor of an early cessation of hostilities between the two countries, and that it acknowledges the complexities in the global economies arising out of the situation. He said both New Delhi and Moscow have a deep understanding of each other s position at the United Nations (UN). The comment was made in reference to India s action at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Thursday. India was one of the 32 nations who abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution that condemned Russia s invasion of Ukraine. India and Germany are of the firm agreement that dialogue and diplomacy are the path forward because peace is beneficial for all developing countries. Both nations are in favor of strengthening the constituency of peace, he added. The German leader, who is on his maiden visit to India since assuming office in end-2021, was visibly impressed by the country s economic growth and development. He had last visited India in 2012 as the mayor of Hamburg, Kwatra said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India and Germany were committed to realizing their untapped potential in sectors such as security and defense cooperation. Germany is in talks with India to sell it six conventional submarines for $5.2 billion. Experts see the move as a bid to wean New Delhi away from its dependence on Russia for military hardware. But the ploy appears duplicitous because of Germany s strong trade ties with both China and Russia. For instance, China is one of the primary buyers of German machine tools and Berlin is heavily dependent on Russia for its energy supplies. Germany is also India s largest trade partner in the 27-member European Union (EU) and has been among New Delhi s top ten global trade partners. Data shows that the total bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $24.8 billion during 2021 22, and over 1,800 German companies are known to operate in India. Germany is the ninth largest investor in India, with cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows of $13.8 billion from April 2000 to September 2022. Transportation, electrical equipment, and metallurgical industries, the services sector (in particular insurance), chemicals, construction activity, trading and automobiles are key areas of German investment in India. Scholz last met Modi at last June's summit of the Group of Seven (G7) industrial powers during an outreach to rally New Delhi s support amid growing concerns over China s backing of Russia over Ukraine.

"25 Feb, 2023",Indian PM offers hints to Russia in critical speech,"Does Narendra Modi s anti-war quote hold a hidden message for Putin? ByJoydeep Sen Gupta, Asia Editor India was among 32 nations that abstained on Thursday in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) vote on a resolution on comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the UN Charter. But New Delhi s position on Russia s military offensive in Ukraine, a conflict that s just marked its first anniversary, is ambiguous on a global stage. On one hand, it seems that India wants to weigh in Moscow s favor and on the other hand, it appears that New Delhi tilts towards the US and the Global North, or the developing economies. If the UNGA move can be seen as a pro-Russia gambit, India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi quote for apromofor the eighth edition of the Raisina Dialogue exposes a duplicitous foreign policy. Raisina Dialogue, which is modeled along the lines of Shangri-La Dialogue and was started by the Modi regime in 2016, is India s flagship conference on geopolitics and geo-economics. The conference is hosted by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), an independent think tank owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, in collaboration with the Ministry of External Affairs of India, and will be held from March 2 to 4. Prime Minister Modi will inaugurate the conference, where the chief guest will be Europe s right-wing poster girl and Italian PM, Giorgia Meloni. The promo aims to showcase PM Modi as a pacifist and an anti-war crusader. It tried to subtly insert a quote in Hindi aaj ka yug yudh ka nahin, which loosely translates to today s era is not one of war in the 110-seconds-long ORF video. Modi had made this remark during the 22nd annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, in September 2022, where Russian President Vladimir Putin was also present. It appears that there is a deliberate attempt to use the quote ahead of the G20 foreign ministers meeting in New Delhi on March 1 and 2. The quote will certainly attract the attention of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is scheduled to arrive in New Delhi on March 1 to take part in the meet. By bringing back Modi s quote, New Delhi appears to be sending a message to President Putin and Moscow to put an end to the special military operation in Ukraine. It also aims to catch Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov s attention, who will be participating in the G20 meeting and the Raisina Dialogue. Lavrov is being seen as the messenger to get the message delivered to President Putin. India, which is trying to assert its position as the self-appointed leading voice of the Global South, or of the developing world, finds it an opportune moment to make a nuanced statement. The ratcheting of tension between the US and Russia must end because it is hurting the global economy and, more significantly, developing nations. Many of these poor countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America, unlike India, have not been able to strike a happy balance between Washington and Moscow and are getting squeezed in this proxy war. Modi s words seek to hit home the point that though India will persist with buying Russian crude oil at a discounted rate, despite US pressure, New Delhi will stand by its democratic beliefs. India seeks to err on the side of caution by being seen with Western democracies and its officials are hosting several American influencers ahead of the G20 foreign ministers meeting. US assistant secretary for energy Geoffrey Pyatt was in town last weekend. On February 20, Modi met a group of US Senators led by Democrat Chuck Schumer, and discussed his shared vision with US President Joe Biden to elevate the bilateral relationship. Does the Modi quote reinforce the argument that New Delhi is speaking with a forked tongue? Indian foreign policy mandarins disagree with that notion. They maintain that this is a sign of the changing times, where an India First foreign policy is the need of the hour. New Delhi decides for itself, and its independent foreign policy cannot be subject to any kind of coercions. India, which is home to one-fifth of the world s population, deserves the right to form and hold its own position and to weigh its own interests in a multipolar world.

"25 Feb, 2023",Russia remains Germany s largest coal supplier Bild,"Berlin reportedly bought nearly 30% of its coal imports from the sanctioned country last year Russia retained its position as Germany s largest coal supplier last year despite sanctions that banned imports of the fossil fuel from the country in mid-2022, Bild newspaper reported on Saturday, citing data from the German Coal Importers Association (VDKi). According to the report, Germany bought a total of 44.4 million tons of coal in 2022 an 8% increase from the year before. While imports of the fossil fuel from Russia plunged by 37% compared to the 2021 figures, the country still delivered roughly 13 million tons to the European nation, representing around 29% of its total imports. Purchases from Germany s other suppliers grew, but still fell short of Russian volumes. The US supplied 9.4 million tons, a 32% increase year-on-year, while Colombia became the third-largest supplier with 7.2 million tons, a surge of 210%. Shipments from South Africa also rose dramatically by 278% year-on-year to 3.9 million tons. Australia was the fourth-largest coal supplier with 6.3 million tons. The EU banned coal imports from Russia on August 10, 2022 as part of a Ukraine-related sanctions package that was announced last April. In 2021, Russia accounted for about 70% of the bloc s coal imports, with Germany and Poland particularly dependent on the Russian fossil fuel, as much of these countries electricity is produced by coal-powered power plants. Taking into account the embargo, it appears that most of the Russian coal was delivered to Germany prior to or shortly after August 10. Germany has been pushed to boost its coal use in recent months as a result of energy shortages and soaring power prices, which were caused by the reduction in gas supplies coming from Russia in the wake of Western sanctions. This has conflicted with the country s long-established commitment to fight climate change and abandon dirty fuel. In a bid to ensure energy security, Berlin even ordered the resumption of activity at idle coal mines last September. According to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), the country currently produces more than one third of its electricity from coal-fired plants. The phasing out of coal-fired power plants has been postponed until March 2024. Earlier this month, VDKi head Alexander Bethe criticized EU and German policies, which seek to abandon coal in favor of cleaner energy, claiming that such plans are too ambitious. He said the notion that Europe will only need coal for another one or two winters is far from reality. It is irresponsible to talk about the end of hard coal without having reliable alternatives. First create efficient green technologies, and then give up [coal]. Not the other way around, Bethe stated. ",https://www.rt.com/business/572049-russia-germany-largest-coal-supplier/
"23 Feb, 2023",Humanitarian crisis looming climate watchdog,"Experts expect below-normal rainfall in the coming months in already drought-stricken parts of the Greater Horn of Africa Large swathes of the Greater Horn of Africa region will not likely see much rain until June, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Center has warned. The organization says that countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda may be on course to experience a drought more severe than that of 2010 to 2012, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The IGAD regional bloc issued the alarming forecast on Wednesday, saying in a statement that in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda that have been most affected by the recent drought, this could be the 6th failed consecutive rainfall season. Rwanda, Burundi, eastern Tanzania, and western South Sudan are likely to face similar adverse weather conditions in parts, they added. With the March-May period contributing up to 60% of the total annual rainfall in parts of the Greater Horn of Africa, the current trends are worse than those observed during the drought of 2010-2011, the weather monitoring organization said. The Food Security and Nutrition Working Group (FSNWG), co-chaired by IGAD, and the UN s Food and Agriculture Organization, estimated that approximately 23 million people are currently facing severe food shortages in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. They added that any changes for the better in the weather during the early summer will have a delayed effect on food security in the region. IGAD s executive secretary, Dr. Workneh Gebeyehu, called for an immediate scaling-up of humanitarian and risk reduction efforts. He urged national governments, as well as humanitarian and development organizations, to adopt a no-regret approach before it s too late. Mohammed Mukhier of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) for Africa expressed concern that the expected drought could further exacerbate humanitarian challenges in the region, including the ongoing hunger crisis, the impacts of COVID-19 and internal displacement. According to UN estimates, 260,000 people, half of them children under five, died of drought-induced starvation in Somalia alone between October 2010 and April 2012.Speaking in 2013, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, Philippe Lazzarini, argued that a lack of early action despite indications of a looming drought was in part to blame for the massive death toll.

Frigates from the Russian, Chinese, and South African navies are set to carry out artillery drills in the Indian Ocean over the weekend. The opening ceremony was overseen by top officials and commanders from the Russian Navy, Chinese Naval Forces and South Africa s Joint Command. The exercises will also be observed by representatives of Brazil s naval forces. Russia will be represented in the drills by the frigate Admiral Gorshkov and the medium sea tanker Kama.

"22 Feb, 2023",South Africa suffers record power cuts,"Eskom, the country s largest producer of electricity, has reduced production to an unprecedented level South Africa s state-owned electricity provider, Eskom, was forced to further slash power output on Tuesday, spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said in a tweet. According to Mantshantsha, the company cut 7,045 megawatts from the grid, in a move known as load shedding, with the total available electricity distributed across the country, effectively leaving large parts of it without power. Earlier cuts removed no more than 6,000 megawatts. The spokesman confirmed that the company had to increase the intensity of the cuts because it cannot meet demand. Eskom supplies most of South Africa s electricity from coal-fired plants. The company has been slashing production because more than half of its capacity in unavailable due to frequent breakdowns at its ageing power stations. Eskom earlier said that the country needs an additional 4,000 to 6,000 megawatts of generating capacity to eliminate the supply-demand gap. However, initiatives to add capacity from private producers have been stalled by legal troubles. The country has suffered power outages every day this year, according to a report from Bloomberg. The South African Reserve Bank recently said the blackouts cost the country about 899 million rand ($49 million) per day. Earlier this month, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster over the electricity crisis. The declaration is expected to enable the government to exempt essential services such as hospitals and water treatment plants from power cuts, and allow the country to buy additional power from its neighbors on an emergency basis, among other measures.

"22 Feb, 2023",Can India supplant China as the voice of the Global South?,"New Delhi seeks to expand its influence over Asian, African and Latin American countries looking for ways out of Beijing s debt burden ByJoydeep Sen Gupta, Asia Editor India is pulling out all the stops to emerge as the self-appointed leading voice of the Global South by dislodging its hostile neighbor China. The developing economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America, collectively dubbed the Global South, will come under New Delhi s soft power lens at the first G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting under India s G20 presidency, which will be held in Bengaluru on February 24 and 25. India s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Reserve Bank governor Dr Shaktikanta Das will jointly chair the meeting. To be sure, in its bid to become the voice of the Global South, India is going up against the financial muscle of China, which is giving away billions of dollars in soft loans and grants to these developing economies. One example of this is Chinese President Xi Jinping s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), extended to around 150 countries and at an estimated cost of $8 trillion, of which Beijing has spent upwards of $1 trillion. New Delhi is taking a contrarian stance to China s and is trying to impress upon the cash-strapped nations across these three continents the importance of debt relief. Otherwise, they may end up with what happened in Sri Lanka last year, where an unprecedented economic crisis triggered in part by external debt led to massive anti-government protests. Pakistan, too, is heading for a similar economic crisis. India is keen to chart its own course as New Delhi is cocking a snook at the US and Western sanctions over Russia s military operation in Ukraine, which enters its second year on Friday the day the meeting in Bengaluru starts. India is willing to play ball with Russia over energy security, while Washington simply can t afford to isolate New Delhi because of its growing geostrategic and economic heft. In absolute numbers, China s economy is far stronger than India s. For instance, whiledata showsthat the gross domestic product (nominal) of both Asian countries was almost equal in 1990, China has since forged ahead at a tremendous pace. As of 2021, China s GDP was 7.7 times greater than India s, while on purchasing power parity (PPP), China outpaced India by 2.7 times. However, there appears to be a discernible shift in the power structure. India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is working on making itself more attractive for foreign investments, which were pegged at about $85 billion last year, compared to China s $189 billion. The paradigm shift is in the works because American policymakers are acutely mindful of the fact that Indian economic growth holds the key to Washington s lofty strategic ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. Successive US administrations irrespective of their political hues are in favor of made-in-India products having access to American markets, as China loses its manufacturing sheen to other Asian nations such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India and Taiwan. In the shifting geostrategic power structure, as exemplified by the running feud between the US and both Russia and China, more emphasis is being laid on the Quad grouping: the US, India, Japan, and Australia. India s priorities during the year-round G20 activities include pushing for a raft of reforms in global institutions, creating awareness of the dire need for economic aid for low- and middle-income countries, who are facing mounting debts and cannot service them. Climate initiatives and sustainability challenges also figure high on the agenda, according to India s Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran. India s G20 sherpa Amitabh Kant, too, has been turning up the heat on China to come clean on its loans to the developing countries. China needs to come out openly and say what their debt is and how to settle it, said Kant, according to a Bloomberg news report. It can t be that the International Monetary Fund [IMF] takes a haircut and goes to settle Chinese debt. How is that possible? Everybody has to take a haircut, the sherpa was quoted as saying. According toWorld Bank, the world's 74 lowest-income nations are indebted to China to various degrees. Countries heavily in debt to China are largely located in Africa, but there are several nations in Central Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific as well. Of the $35 billion that these low-income nations, such as Angola, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, owed in debt service payments last year, about 37% or $13.1 billion was to state-run Chinese entities. The Global South is facing critical issues like an unabated rise in the prices of crude oil, food, and fertilizers, in addition to the mounting debt and rapidly deteriorating economic growth. Last November, during his talks with Russia s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, Jaishankar said, The Global South feels the pain [of rising prices]. He spelled out India s need to buy oil from Russia. India is the third-largest consumer of oil and gas, where incomes are not very high. We need to look for affordable sources, so the India-Russia relationship works to our advantage. We will keep it going. Earlier, Jaishankar had defined the thrust of New Delhi s G20 presidency, and referred to India as the voice of the Global South. Modi appeared to have taken a cue from Jaishankar and convened a virtual summit of developing countries on January 12 13, which he christened the Voice of the Global South Summit. Eight ministerial-level thematic sessions were held, which involved the ministers of finance, trade, environment, energy, health, and education. Two sessions were for the foreign ministers, where the focus was on the priorities of the Global South, and their suggestions for India as the G20 president. Valuable input was provided by foreign participants. For example, Mozambique s President Filipe Nyusi emphasized the need for concerted international efforts to focus global attention on promoting the interests of the developing world. Nigeria s President Muhammadu Buhari drew attention to the huge debt burden that had derailed many countries development plans. Developing countries should put forward a common agenda to present our collective demands to the Global North, he said. Bangladesh s PM Sheikh Hasina Wajed presented a bouquet of six proposals: maintaining world peace and stability; creating a new paradigm to tackle inequality holistically in accord with sustainable development goals; special financing for the most vulnerable nations; bridging digital divides; ensuring that all human beings, including Myanmar s Rohingya refugees sheltered in her country, have an equal right to lead a decent life; and fostering tripartite cooperation to ensure global human development. Modi emphasized that the Global South wanted a globalization that brings prosperity and well-being to humanity as a whole. He added that a human-centric globalization was the need of the hour and solemnly assured his guests that India's G-20 Presidency will attempt to voice the views of the Global South on these important issues. New Delhi touted it as the biggest digital conference of the leaders and ministers of the developing world. As far as India is concerned, your voice is India's voice. Your priorities are India's priorities, Modi said. Altogether, 125 nations took part in the digital conference. The geographical breakdown was 29 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean, 47 countries from Africa, seven countries from Europe, 31 countries from Asia, and 11 countries from Oceania. Of them, 11 countries participated at the leaders level at the inaugural session and seven countries took part in deliberations at the concluding session, both chaired by Modi. Terming the summit a unique beginning, India s Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra stressed that its key feature was the need for articulating the voice of the Global South in international institutions and for reforming them for a balanced representation of the developing countries. He promised the strongest endeavors by the government to channel their ideas, priorities and concerns into the G20 process, piloted by India. In its quest to become a leader among developing economies, India is facing great challenges, but is firmly set on exploiting every opening and take its place among the key figures of the emerging multipolar world. And it has the edge necessary to do so, thanks to its equidistant ties to the US and Russia and robust trade links to China, which have endured despite the two nations cross-border disputes.",https://www.rt.com/india/571865-india-supplant-china-beijing/
"21 Feb, 2023", Big difference between arming Ukraine and Russia Borrell,"The EU s top diplomat told China s state councilor that Brussels holds itself to different rules The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has refused to reveal exactly what explanation he gave to Chinese state councilor Wang Yi for his contention that there is ""a difference"" between arming Russia and Ukraine. The exchange came after Wang asked Borrell why he was so concerned with Beijing potentially giving weapons to Moscow when Brussels is funnelling arms to Kiev, the latter told reporters on Tuesday. The two met at the Munich Security Conference last week, after which the Spaniard warned that any Chinese assistance to the Russian military would be considered a red line by the EU. Speaking to reporters at a NATO meeting on Tuesday, Borrell said that he and Wang had a frank conversation in Munich. During this conversation, Wang made it clear that China doesn t provide arms to countries at war, and had no plans of providing arms to Russia. This, Wang said, is the principle of China s foreign policy, according to Borrell s recollection. However, Borrell said that Wang asked him: Why do you show concern for me maybe providing arms for Russia when you are providing arms for Ukraine? Borrell said that he responded by explaining the big difference between these scenarios, pointing out what is at stake for us Europeans in the war in Ukraine. However, he did not share his explanation with the press. Borrell is not the only senior Western diplomat to caution Beijing over its alleged support for Russia s military. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed last week that Washington was already aware of China s non-lethal support for Moscow, and threatened serious consequences if that support escalated to lethal weapons. China s foreign ministry responded to Blinken in a similar manner as Wang did to Borrell, urging the US to seriously reflect on its role in stoking the Ukraine conflict. It is the US, not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield, a ministry spokesman said on Monday. China has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and plans on releasing apeace proposalin the near future. Meanwhile, Beijing and Moscow have stepped up their bilateral trade since the beginning of Russia s military operation in Ukraine last February, and both countries are currently taking part in trilateralnaval drillswith South Africa. Ahead of a potential visit to Moscow by Chinese President Xi Jinping this spring, Wang held a meeting in the Russian capital with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev on Tuesday. Sino-Russian relations are rock solid and will withstand any test of the changing international situation, Wang said after the meeting.

"19 Feb, 2023","Fidel Castro s legacy lives on as Cuba keeps sending doctors, not bombs all across the world","The iconic revolutionary leader stepped down as president 15 years ago, but his nation sticks to his course Daniel Kovalikteaches International Human Rights at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, and is author of the recently-released book Nicaragua: A History of US Intervention & Resistance. Daniel Kovalikteaches International Human Rights at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, and is author of the recently-released book Nicaragua: A History of US Intervention & Resistance. In the immediate aftermath of the recent devastating earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria, Cuba dispatched medical teams to the affected areas to provide care to victims. Their departure was marked by a farewell ceremony, which featured a large photo of Fidel Castro. It was quite appropriate, for the international medical solidarity which Cuba regularly extends to countries throughout the world is the brainchild of the late iconic leader himself, who, in 2003,proudly proclaimedthat Cuba does not drop bombs on other countries but instead sends them doctors. Though Castro retired from his official duties as President of Cuba 15 years ago to the day, he has continued to remain a leader in solidarity and in peace. Cuban doctors were sent to more than 70 countries over the years, including nearly 40 different countries in 2020 to help in the fight against Covid-19. In 2010, eventheNew York TimesacknowledgedCuba s successful campaign against the cholera epidemic which broke out in Haiti after another earthquake. In 2014, theTimessimilarlygave creditto Cuba s leadership in successfully fighting Ebola in Africa: Cuba is an impoverished island that remains largely cut off from the world and lies about 4,500 miles from the West African nations where Ebola is spreading at an alarming rate. Yet, having pledged to deploy hundreds of medical professionals to the front lines of the pandemic, Cuba stands to play the most robust role among the nations seeking to contain the virus. Cuba s contribution is doubtlessly meant at least in part to bolster its beleaguered international standing. Nonetheless, it should be lauded and emulated. In addition, patients from 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries have traveled to Cuba to have their eyesight restored by Cuban doctors in what was dubbed Operation Miracle. Among them was Mario Teran, the Bolivian soldier who shot and killed Che Guevara. In 2014, Fidelreceived the Confucius Peace Awardfor his efforts in ending tensions with the United States and for his work to eliminate nuclear weapons. In addition,he played a key rolein helping initiate, host and mediate the peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC guerillas which resulted in a peace deal in 2016, ending 52 years of brutal civil conflict. The historic role that Fidel Castro played was always outsized for a country as small as the island nation of Cuba, and as a result, his impact was felt beyond its borders. One of the first countries that Cuba aided, back in the early 1960s, was Algeria, which had recently won its independence from France. As described by Piero Gleijeses, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, in his bookConflicting Missions: It was an unusual gesture: an underdeveloped country tendering free aid to another in even more dire straits. It was offered at a time when the exodus of doctors from Cuba following the revolution had forced the government to stretch its resources while launching its domestic programs to increase mass access to health care. It was like a beggar offering his help, but we knew the Algerian people needed it even more than we did and that they deserved it, [Cuban Minister of Public Health] Machado Ventura remarked. It was an act of solidarity that brought no tangible benefit and came at real material cost. This can be said of all of Cuba s acts of international solidarity. Meanwhile, what very few in the West know is that Cuba, under Fidel s leadership and with the support of the USSR, played a key role in liberating southern Africa from US and apartheid-era South African domination, and in ultimately ending apartheid in the country itself. It was for this reason that the first nation Nelson Mandela visited after his release from prison was Cuba. While there,Mandela lauded the nationas a source of inspiration to all freedom-loving people. Even theWashington PostrecognizedFidel Castro as a hero of Africa. After the Chernobyl disaster of 1989, Cubatook in and treated 24,000 affected children. Many of these individuals and their families still live there to this day. This act of solidarity cannot be understated given the economic conditions in the island nation at the time. While Cuba benefited greatly from the support of the USSR and Eastern Bloc after its 1959 Revolution, which Fidel led, by 1989 the Communist governments had fallen and aid from the USSR itself, which would collapse in 1991, was drying up. As a result of all of this, Cuba would enter what it called its Special Period, a time of great economic deprivation which many believed would lead to the collapse of the Cuban Revolution as well. But Fidel and Cuba hung on, and they continued to extend help to people around the world even while they were having trouble feeding their own people. Due to the intensification of US sanctions and the blockade of Cuba under President Donald Trump, and continued under President Biden, Cuba has now entered a time rivaling the Special Period. Even before Trump s tightening of the sanctions unrelenting US economic war against Cuba, described by Havana as genocidal, had cost the countryan estimated $1.1 trillion in revenue and had denied the Cuban people life-saving medicine, nutritious food, and vital agricultural equipment. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic,the US even blockeddelivery of critical medical aid, including masks and diagnostic equipment, to Cuba. The US is punishing Cuba and the Cuban people not for their shortcomings and failures, but because of their very successes. And amongst the successes of the Cuban Revolution which Fidel Castro led even after officially stepping down from power, is Cuba s unequaled solidarity to the world. Fidel s doctors, not bombs speech implicitly contrasted his country with the US, which is by farthe world s largest arms supplierwhile helping less and less with humanitarian aid. Indeed,US sanctions are directly standing in the wayof humanitarian efforts in countries like Syria a country the US continues to economically strangle even in the face of the recent earthquake. Jose Marti, the Cuban revolutionary and poet who inspired Fidel Castro himself, once said that there are two kinds of people in the world those who love and create, and those who hate and destroy. It is evident that Cuba, continuously inspired by the ideas and example of Fidel, is of the former type. ",https://www.rt.com/news/571705-fidel-cuba-legacy-doctors/
"19 Feb, 2023",Chinese tourists change travel destinations,"A number of countries have imposed flight restrictions and entrance rules aimed exclusively at Beijing The gradual reopening of China s economy following the end of Covid-19 lockdowns has propelled tourism outside its borders, but lingering pandemic-induced problems have seen Chinese altering their travel preferences, CNBC reported this week, citing data from booking website Ctrip. According to the report, travel bookings by Chinese tourists going abroad surged by 640% during the Lunar New Year holidays compared with the same time last year, while overseas hotel bookings have quadrupled. Last year Chinese travelers singled out Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea as their top travel spots, but this year the majority of travelers went instead to Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Bali. The change is based partly on flight restrictions, visa issues and lingering pandemic-related entrance rules affecting Chinese passport holders. Chinese citizens were unable to obtain visas to South Korea and Japan after both countries stopped processing them over concerns about China s recent surge in Covid-19 infections. In Europe, vacationers from China have to wait an extended period of time to obtain visas due to high demand. Prior to the pandemic, EU visa applications took only several days to be processed, while now applicants have to wait up to two months to get a Schengen stamp, according to the SchengenVisaInfo.com website. Thailand is the top choice for Chinese group tours at the moment, according to Ctrip data, with Maldives and Egypt coming in as the second and third most popular choices. Group tours are now also allowed from China to Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Laos, as well as the UAE, South Africa, Hungary, Cuba and Russia. Meanwhile Japan, South Korea and Vietnam still prohibit group tours. China s borders were largely closed to tourist travel from 2019 due to the Covid pandemic. The reopening that kicked off in December last year saw the government scrapping mandatory quarantines for those visiting mainland China, restarting its visa-free policy and resuming group tour travel. Analysts expect Beijing s move to help restore Asia s pandemic-battered retail sector and hotel industry. ",https://www.rt.com/business/571462-chinese-tourists-travel-destinations/
"18 Feb, 2023",Israeli delegation removed from African summit,"Israel blamed the incident on South Africa and Algeria, but African Union officials say they were just following protocol A senior Israeli diplomat and her delegation have been expelled from the African Union s annual summit in Ethiopia. Video footage showed the Israelis being escorted out by security guards. Sharon Bar-li, the deputy director of the Israeli foreign ministry s Africa division, was removed from the premises in Addis Ababa along with her team on Saturday. The Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the expulsion, arguing that Israel is an accredited observer at the African Union s annual meeting, and Bar-li had her paperwork in order. Israel looks harshly upon the incident in which the deputy director for Africa, Ambassador Sharon Bar-Li, was removed from the African Union hall despite her status as an accredited observer with entrance badges, spokesperson Lior Hayat said. Hayat blamed a small number of extremist countries such as Algeria and South Africa for the decision to boot Bar-li, claiming that these nations are driven by hatred and controlled by Iran. Israel was granted observer status at the African Union in 2021, although the decision was bitterly opposed by some members of the 55-country bloc, including South Africa and Algeria. The union responded by setting up a committee to re-evaluate Israel s status, which is due to give its recommendations at this year s summit. A spokesperson for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa denied any responsibility, while an African Union spokesperson Ebba Kalondo told Reuters that the union was expecting Israel s ambassador to Ethiopia and the African Union, Aleli Admasu, instead of Bar-li. Regardless, South Africa backed the decision to expel the diplomat. It s not about South Africa or Algeria, it s an issue of principle, Ramaphosa s spokesperson told Reuters. Until the AU takes a decision on whether to grant Israel observer status, you cannot have the country sitting and observing. ",https://www.rt.com/news/571715-israel-ambassador-african-union/
"18 Feb, 2023",Putin speaks on partnership with Africa,"Russia and African nations are united in their desire for a fair, multipolar world, the Russian president says President Vladimir Putin has hailed the growing partnership between Russia and Africa, saying he hopes to further boost cooperation with the continent. In an address to the African Union (AU) summit, published on the Kremlin website on Saturday, Putin praised the AU as an authoritative international structure, playing a vital role in settling local conflicts, assuring stability, and strengthening ties between African nations. For Russia, African states have always been and remain important and reliable partners. We are united by the desire to build a just and multipolar world order, based on true equality and rule of international law, free from any form of discrimination, forceful dictatorship and sanctions pressure, the Russian leader told the gathering, now underway in Ethiopia s capital, Addis Ababa. Putin also reiterated his invitation to African leaders to attend the second Russia-Africa Summit, scheduled to take place in St Petersburg this July. The first such forum, held in Sochi in 2019, created good conditions for intensifying our traditionally friendly relations, both on the bilateral level and on a multilateral basis, he said. The event in St Petersburg should allow the sides to set new goals in expanding their cooperation further in various areas, the president added. I look forward to continued constructive joint work for the benefit of our countries and peoples, in the interests of ensuring peaceful and prosperous development of the African continent, Putin wrote. Relations between Russia and Africa have become closer during the conflict in Ukraine, as many nations on the continent have resisted Western pressure to condemn and sanction Moscow. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has made two African tours in less than a year, visiting Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of the Congo in summer, and traveling to South Africa, Angola, Eswatini and Eritrea a few weeks ago.

"17 Feb, 2023",South Africa to kick off military drills with Russia and China,"Moscow is represented at the Mosi II exercises by vessels including the Admiral Gorshkov frigate Trilateral exercises featuring the navies of South Africa, Russia, and China are expected to kick off in the Indian Ocean off the port cities of Durban and Richards Bay on Friday, according to the South African Defense Ministry. South Africa will host the Chinese and Russian Federation navies in a multilateral maritime exercise between February 17 and 27, the South African military said in a statement last month. The drills are aimed at assisting in joint disaster systems management enhancement, maritime cooperation, and anti-piracy experience. Some 350 personnel will feature in the 10-day joint exercise dubbed Mosi II , the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) said. Among Russia s participating vessels is the Admiral Gorshkov frigate, which docked in Cape Town on Monday before continuing on to Durban. The ship is equipped with Zircon hypersonic missiles, which have a range of 620 miles and travel at nine times the speed of sound. A source close to Russia s defense industry told TASS earlier this month that the Zircon missiles will be tested during the drills.

Primary opposition party the Democratic Alliance claimed that the exercises mean their country is effectively picking a side in the conflict. South Africa has technically maintained a position of neutrality throughout the hostilities in Ukraine. It abstained from a UN vote condemning Russia s military offensive, while refusing to join US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. The three nations conducted similar exercises in 2019. South Africa responded to criticism by noting that it routinely engages in naval exercises with other nations such as France and the US.

"17 Feb, 2023","Kosovo, Donbass and Catalonia are famous examples, but do you realize how many countries have problems with separatism?","More than 100 governments recognized Kosovo s self-proclaimed independence 15 years ago, but most of them have their own issues of this kind In February of 2008, Kosovo s parliament dominated by Albanian separatists declared the province s independence from Serbia. Belgrade objected to the move, but it the new ""state"" was recognized the very next day by the United States, Britain, France, Turkiye, and Albania. More than 50 countries followed by the end of that year. As of now, almost 100 UN member states have recognized Kosovo s sovereignty. However, this figure is in constant flux, as some countries have withdrawn their support due to Belgrade s diplomatic efforts. Nevertheless, Pristina continues to claim that 117 countries support its ""independence."" In fact, more than half of the countries belonging to the UN do not recognize Kosovo s independence. Among these are China, India, most of the post-Soviet countries, as well as several EU members, namely Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Romania, and Slovakia. Russia is one of the main opponents of Kosovo s declaration of independence and has been consistent about the consequences for the world order. Upon closer examination, it turns out that the vast majority of global states are dealing with some form of separatist issues, ranging from significant to very minor. The disputed status of Kosovo is only the latest instance of separatism resulting in the emergence of a new state-like entity in the Balkans. The disintegration of the region has been dubbed Balkanization , and deservedly so. At the end of the last century, most of the Balkans were incorporated into a united country called Yugoslavia. Today, there are seven independent countries in its place, but this is by no means where it might end. Serbia was the first to face the problem of Albanian separatism, but there are Albanian communities in other nations throughout the region including Montenegro, Greece, and Northern Macedonia. In the latter, the threat is especially acute, since Albanians, who account for 25% of the country s total population, live in the country s western regions adjacent to Kosovo. In addition to the Kosovo problem, Serbia has potential issues with Vojvodina an autonomous region inhabited not only by Serbs, but also Hungarians, who have a very strong regional identity. Kosovo also has its own internal challenges. In the northern part of the province, there is an enclave populated mainly by Serbs, who do not like the prospect of being isolated from their larger homeland. Likewise, problems with separatism have inevitably arisen in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Republika Srpska, which is part of it, looks towards independence or reunification with Serbia and has increasingly expressed views on the future that contradict those of the central government. The same problem, though less acute, can be found in Croatian enclaves of Bosnia, as well as Croatia itself, where there are enclaves of Serbs. If there wasn t a king sitting in Madrid who still unites most of the peninsula, Balkanization might well have been called Iberization there are more separatist movements in Spain than any other Western European country. The whole world is well aware of the problem of Catalonia. Just five years ago, in October 2017, the local authorities there held a referendum on independence, which ended in failure, despite the fact that more than 90% of those who voted supported the separation of the region from Spain. Madrid refused to recognize this expression of the people s will. In the aftermath, some of the leaders of the Catalan separatist movement were arrested, while others managed to flee the country. However, this has hardly quashed the desire of local residents. In addition to the Catalan issue, there is also Basque separatism, which, unlike the Catalonian variety, often takes on more radical forms. Radical nationalists from ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna Basque Country and Freedom) fought for independence from Spain and the Spanish crown for more than 40 years, killing 800 people. In 2018, the group announced its self-dissolution, but this doesn t mean that the problem has gone away. One of the largest parties in the region, the Basque Nationalist Party, still supports the idea of independence from Madrid. Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities, or regions. While not reaching the level of separatism, the idea of regional autonomy flourishes in each of them to one degree or another. In local elections, candidates who call for more independence and autonomy regularly garner a large percentage of the vote in Aragon, Andalusia, Castile, Asturias, Cantabria, and Galicia, as well as other autonomous communities. And not all is sweetness and light in the Iberian peninsula s other country, Portugal, either though it s true that the regions seeking to free themselves from the power of Lisbon are separated from that metropolis by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean: we re talking the archipelago of Madeira and the Azores. Scottish separatism has been haunting London for the past few years. After independence supporters won the last regional elections, they announced their intention to hold a second referendum on seceding from the United Kingdom. The first was held in 2014, when 55% opposed the divorce, and 45% supported it. Confident in the results of the vote, London didn t interfere with the will of the Scots at that time. However, two years later, the UK voted to leave the European Union, and Edinburgh demanded a new referendum, as Scots clearly wanted to stay in the EU, having voted against by a landslide 62%. The Scottish authorities had wanted to hold a new referendum in October 2023, but, last November, Great Britain s Supreme Court ruled that plebiscites on independence cannot be held without London s consent. This time the Tory-controlled parliament does not intend to grant it. Edinburgh has no intention of giving up, with the former head of the Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon promising Scottish democracy will not be denied. Last week, Sturgeon announced her resignation as Scotland s first minister, but still, speaking of her successor, she expressed confidence that the person will lead Scotland to independence. Relations with Northern Ireland are no less problematic for London. In local elections in the spring of 2022, the Sinn Fein party, which advocates for reuniting with the Republic of Ireland and seceding from the Uk, won regional elections for the first time. The Northern Ireland Protocol, signed between London and the EU during Brexit, probably contributed to the separatists growing popularity. The document calls for preserving a single customs space between Dublin and Belfast, while actually introducing customs between Britain and Northern Ireland. London's issues don t stop there with varying degrees of separatist activity in Cornwall, Mercia (the West Midlands and East Midlands regions), Northumberland, Yorkshire, Jersey, and Wales, and even talk of England itself exiting the UK. However, these appear to be trite compared to the Scottish and Irish questions. For the most part, the countries of Western Europe seem to be exemplary unitary states, and generally that is what they are. However, there are also strong regional identities, as well as desires for more autonomy and separatist leanings. In France, for example, there is the problem of the Occitans, who occupy a huge area in the south of the country as many as seven regions. Even an aggressive Francization policy wasn t sufficient to solve this problem definitively: all signs in the region are regularly duplicated in Occitanian. Brittany, in the northwest of the country, also has a strong regional identity. Its inhabitants have their own Celtic language and prefer to call themselves Bretons, rather than French. In the last half of the 20th century, the Breton Liberation Front, which is the armed wing of the Breton Revolutionary Army, carried out terrorist attacks, while barking out slogans advocating independence for their homeland. In Corsica, radical groups haven t shied away from employing violent means to achieve independence, even in this century. Each of these separatist communities boasts a political wing the Occitan Party, the Breton Party, and the Free Corsica Party whose programs range from demanding greater autonomy to calling for full independence. The last instance of violence occurred in the summer of last year, when the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) claimed responsibility for 16 arson attacks and took credit for bombing summer residences owned by non-Corsicans, as well as construction companies and police cars. The EU s economic locomotive, Germany, has a problem in Bavaria a rich region that occupies about 20% of the total area of the country bordering the Czech Republic and Austria. Bavarians are significantly different from other Germans. Their dialect is actually considered to be a separate language, if not officially recognized as such. Although regional identity is extremely strong, Bavarians rarely speak about separatism, at least publicly. But even in the absence of conflict, Berlin keeps its eye on Munich. One of Germany s main parties, the Christian Democratic Union, whose representatives have repeatedly been selected as Germany s Chancellor, does not contest elections in Bavaria. Instead, it works in an alliance with the purely Bavarian Christian Social Union party, which has absorbed most of the separatist and radical nationalist Bavarian parties over time. In Italy, the issue of independence is being discussed in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. And these discussions are rather unpleasant for Rome. For example, Venetian politicians have managed to have Venetic recognized as an official language in their region, along with Italian. In March of 2014, 89% of respondents in an online poll conducted in the region supported creating a sovereign Federal Republic of Veneto. However, it hasn t advanced to a referendum yet. The desire to achieve greater independence in these areas mainly stems from economic factors, but in South Tyrol, the national question also plays a role. This rich German-speaking region, which became part of Italy only after the First World War, has been striving to reunify with Austria for more than a century. The most likely candidate for disintegration in Western Europe is undoubtedly Belgium. It consists of two regions inhabited by very different peoples: Dutch-speaking Flemings, who make up about 60% of the country s population, and French-speaking Walloons, who account for 40%. The linguistic division is aggravated by serious economic inequality between the regions the Flemings have every reason to believe that their southern neighbors in Wallonia, whose unemployment rate is twice as high and GDP per capita a third lower, are living at their expense. Thirty years ago, Flanders dissatisfaction with this situation contributed to transforming a unified Belgium into a federation. Now the Flemings are fighting to extend their autonomy further, while the Walloons attempt to repulse their efforts. The problem of separatism is even more acute in Eastern Europe, especially in post-Soviet space, where wars have often broken out due to the inability of central and regional authorities to reach agreements. These regions include Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and eastern Ukraine. But separatist aspirations are not confined to Europe. They can also be found in Asia, Africa, and even Oceania. This is especially true in countries with a colonial past, where borders were often drawn under external pressure without regard to local factors and the traditional homelands of tribes and peoples. The strongest non-European powers today are not without this problem either. The world is well aware of the separatist threats facing China. The United States has recently been increasingly touting claims for independence from Taiwan, Tibet, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Hong Kong, and Macau. A little more than half a century ago, Beijing was also fighting separatism in Inner Mongolia, but demographic trends have rendered this problem less relevant. That said, even the US itself, which from the outside appears to be one of the most monolithic nations in the word, could easily bedividedinto 11 smaller nations. Stories about Americans pushing for the independence of individual states California and Texas, for example pop up in the media from time to time, while more exotic movements advocating the independence of entire regions, such as Cascadia or the Republic of New Africa, also exist. At any rate, a complete list of all the separatist movements around the world would occupy a separate room in a library. Timofey Bordachev, program director at the Valdai Club, in Moscow, believes that Globally, separatism is a reaction to disassociation, the construction of new fences, and the rise of nationalism. If there was real globalization, there would be no separatism. Borders would be transparent, and people wouldn t care where they live. Separatism is a struggle against the nationalism of the titular nation. Why do residents of Donbass and Eastern Ukraine want to get out from under Kiev s power? The reason is Ukrainian nationalism. Why did separatists wanting to break with Georgia appear in South Ossetia and Abkhazia? Because Tbilisi tried to impose Georgian nationalism on these regions. That s it. The reason behind separatism always stems from the nationalism of the larger nation, the expert told RT. Nikolay Topornin, associate professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Department of European Law, has a slightly different point of view. According to him, There is no clear relation between separatist tendencies and global integration processes. Each case has its own history, its own characteristics, its own roots. But yes, most often a whole complex of historical, cultural, religious, linguistic, educational, and economic reasons lies behind each example of separatism, he pointed out. In some sense, globalization has contributed to the growth of separatism, according to the expert. One of its consequences has been the appearance ofglocalization, with regional differences strengthening, rather than disappearing as expected. Instead of merging and unifying, trends in the opposite direction are emerging and gaining strength: separatist leanings, increased attention on local differences, heightened interest in ancient traditions, and the revival of dialects, he said. Under these conditions, there are only two ways to fight separatism: repression and concessions. Countries often employ both of these methods simultaneously by persecuting separatist-minded activists, while granting separatist regions more autonomy at the same time. However, according to Timofey Bordachev, there is a more universal prescription: Is there a theoretical solution to the problem of separatism? Yes. It s an empire. The only prescription for separatism is an empire: large multinational, multi-confessional countries, such as Russia, China, and, to some extent, the United States.

"17 Feb, 2023",Top Russian academic explains rapprochement with Africa,"The conflict in Ukraine has revealed Moscow s true friends and foes, head of the Institute for African Studies says Many African countries have resisted pressure to condemn Moscow over the Ukraine conflict because they see that the West is now using the same methods of colonial oppression against Russia that their own continent had suffered from, Irina Abramova, director of the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has told RT. The conflict in Ukraine has given a new impetus to Russia s return to Africa. It tore away the disguises, revealing our true friends and foes, Abramova said in an interview on Friday. The African nations weren t afraid to speak up against the economic sanctions [on Moscow] and stood firm in the face of enormous pressure from the West. Despite certain inconsistencies during the voting on some of the UN s anti-Russian resolutions, their behavior was exemplary, she recalled. Last March, 26 African countries out of 54 refused to support a UN resolution condemning Russia, mostly abstaining or not submitting their votes. The number of nations from the continent who didn t back a similar document in October, had increased to 28. One of the reasons for that was that Africa sees that the same methods of colonial oppression once utilized against Africa are being used today against Russia, the academic explained. The Africans are also grateful [to Moscow] because they remember how the Soviet Union helped them achieve both political and economic sovereignty, Abramova said. The USSR built over 300 major industrial enterprises, more than 1,000 infrastructure facilities, and trained over 500,000 staff in Africa, she said. Russia reducing its activities on the continent in the 1990s was a big mistake and now we re starting to realize it, the academic pointed out. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has made two African tours in less than a year, visiting Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of the Congo in summer, and traveling to South Africa, Angola, Eswatini and Eritrea in January. Moscow has a lot to gain from restoring relations with Africa because the continent is a global leader in financial technology and decentralized finance, or a third of resources that the world s green economies and defense industries require are located in Africa, or that 60% of the continent s people are younger than 25 years of age, meaning that they are the future of the world, Abramova pointed out. Africa, for its part, is interested in boosting trade with Russia while dealing without middlemen, as well as getting access to Russian technologies that are essential to speed up its modernization, she said.

"15 Feb, 2023",Investigators claim Israeli group meddling in elections worldwide," Team Jorge reportedly deployed thousands of bots to shift public opinion A secretive Israeli group allegedly manipulated more than 30 elections worldwide using hacking and state-of-the art disinformation techniques, according to an investigation conducted by an international consortium of journalists. Several media outlets, including the Guardian, Le Monde, ZDF, Der Spiegel and El Pais looked into a team of contractors known as Team Jorge , run by Tal Hanan, a 50-year-old former Israeli secret services operative. The latter has denied any wrongdoing. To expose the group s alleged clandestine operations, the reporters passed themselves as prospective clients while covertly recording several hours of footage inside the meetings with the unit's members. Hanan allegedly told reporters that his services could be used by both private companies and intelligence agencies, with operations taking place in Europe and Africa, as well as in North, Central and South America. In a video clip released by The Guardian on Wednesday, Hanan himself appears to boast that his group has completed 33 presidential-level campaigns 27 of which were successful. He also reportedly said that he took part in two major projects in the US, adding that he does not engage directly in the nation s politics. According to the investigation, Team Jorge would charge their clients between 6 and 15 million ($6.4 16 million) to interfere in elections. During the meetings, the team reportedly demonstrated their methods for swaying elections, which included cyber hacking and special operations. The key tool in the group s arsenal, however, appears to be a software package called Advanced Impact Media Solutions, or Aims. With its help, the group is believed to be controlling some 30,000 sophisticated bots on various social media platforms. The team also reportedly claimed that it had planted the required information in legitimate new outlets. Against this backdrop, French BFM TV Channel suspended one of its anchors, Rachid M Barki, after undercover journalists were reportedly told by one of Team Jorge members that the group was behind one report broadcasted by the outlet. M Barki himself told Politico that he used information that [he] received from sources and that they did not necessarily follow the usual editorial process.

"15 Feb, 2023",Russia makes claim over West s hybrid war ,"Moscow s rivals are seeking to turn it into a pariah, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed The West is attempting to use the Ukraine conflict to portray Russia as a rogue state in the eyes of the world, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday. He stressed that the strategy has not been successful. The US and its satellite states are waging an all-encompassing hybrid war that they have long been preparing for, and are using Ukrainian radical nationalists as a battering ram against us, Lavrov outlined in a speech to the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma. They are not even trying to hide the goal of this war: it is not only to defeat our country on the battlefield and destroy our economy, but also to surround us with a sanitary cordon and turn us into a type of a rogue state. The statement came the same day that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals for a new sanctions package against Russia, including additional export bans and measures to prevent the bypassing of restrictions. Lavrov said that the West s efforts to isolate Russia have failed because Moscow continues to develop relations with partners in other areas of the globe. He added that nations that have refused to back the unprecedented sanctions make up the majority of the world s population. The countries of the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and South America don t want to live in accordance with the West-centric order, the Russian minister stated. So it makes perfect sense why three-quarters of the world s countries have not joined the anti-Russian sanctions and have a reasonable view regarding the situation in Ukraine. China and India are among the major economies that have refused to impose restrictions on Moscow. Denis Alipov, Russia s ambassador to New Delhi, said on Tuesday that sanctions had an opposite effect and facilitated more trade and closer cooperation between Russia and India. Beijing, meanwhile, has accused the US of fueling the Ukraine conflict and trying to weaponize the world economy for its own benefit. ",https://www.rt.com/russia/571518-lavrov-west-hybrid-war/
"15 Feb, 2023",Western diplomacy is immature and incapable of dialogue Russian ambassador to India,"The epicenter of world politics and economic development has shifted eastwards, towards a more equal and balanced dispensation of power' The Russian ambassador to India, Denis Alipov, assumed office early in 2022, having worked in the country in various diplomatic capacities for decades. On the occasion of Russian Diplomats Day, which was observed at the nation s missions around the world on February 10, Alipov spoke with RT on a host of issues, ranging from the challenges faced by diplomats following the launch of Moscow s military operation in Ukraine, to Indo-Russian defense deals and the journey towards a multipolar world, as well as the rise of the Global South. RT: This year was certainly not easy for Russian diplomacy after the start of the military operation in Donbass. But did Russian diplomats in India and other Asian countries feel it? How did the operation affect your work personally? Denis Alipov:Last year was indeed unusual. The intensity, the challenges, and the scope of work for the Russian foreign service have substantially increased. In India, the Russian Embassy operates in a completely different environment as compared to Europe and the US, which chose to almost completely freeze the relationship with Russia. In my view, it reflects the immaturity of Western diplomacy, which is incapable of dialogue and compromise at the time of crisis, which it itself created as is evident from the deceitful subversion of the negotiation process over Ukraine. We have maintained close communication with the Indian government and continuously expand our engagement with the public. It is indicative of the friendly and strategic nature of our traditional partnership. In 2022, we have seen notable upward dynamics of various exchanges and an increase of interest to explore new avenues in trade. Our dialogue on political and strategic matters as well as in defense and other sensitive areas is extremely candid and intense. - Do you have the feeling that a new world order is being formed? If so, what will it be like? And what place in this world will be occupied by BRICS, SCO, and other organizations in which Russia and India act as equal partners? - Obviously, the progress towards the multipolar world order has accelerated. The clout of India, China, Brazil, South Africa in global decision-making has increased dramatically. There is no turning back to the Western-centric globalization model, which failed to ensure lasting stability and sustainable development. The US, on the contrary, seems unable to relinquish its hegemony and continues to promote a confrontational agenda, resorting to double standards and interference in domestic affairs. Acting a little more subtly by engaging with other countries on the notion of the so-called rules-based order, it doesn t conceal the intention to set up a new international order on Western patterns. Needless to say, these actions undermine the existing system of international law which rests on the UN Charter, where all countries are deemed equal. On the contrary, Russia and the majority of likeminded countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America stand for an equal multipolar world arrangement based on the central role of the UN and international law. BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa] and the SCO [Shanghai Cooperation Organization] agenda is very much focused on that, as reflected by a growing number of new candidates aspiring to join these associations. Importantly, the current Indian G20 presidency is a case in point. India is resisting the attempts to politicize this crucial forum and puts forward the role of developing countries, which are suffering the most from the energy and food crises and supply chain disruptions caused by the Western unilateral sanctions. - India is already an important partner for Russia. Do you expect its role to increase in the coming years alongside Moscow s renewed focus on the Global South? - Throughout the 75 years of diplomatic relations, India retained a special focus in Russian foreign policy that is evident in proud landmarks in industry, science, defense, energy, nuclear power, space, and humanitarian ties. Our cooperation has always been mutually beneficial and complementary. We have no political differences but a common desire to further deepen and diversify our partnership, which got special and privileged status in 2010. Obviously, India s role in regional and global affairs is on the rise as Russia has put emphasis on its partners in the East and Global South. The epicenter of world politics and economic development has clearly shifted eastwards and this will facilitate a more equal and balanced dispensation of power. Russia, being itself a nation of the East and the Pacific, is set together with India to take a major part in that process. - What s the latest update on the production of T-90 tanks, Sukhoi 30 MKI fighter jets, AK-203 assault rifles, and other weapons under New Delhi s Make in India initiative? What s the status of the joint project on the creation of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and the supply of S-400 missile systems? - Russia-India defense cooperation is the strongest pillar of the bilateral special and privileged strategic partnership. It has a decades-long and time-tested background and remains unprecedented. It reflects a unique and deep-rooted trust between our countries and dedication to go ahead. Unlike other countries, Russia offers the maximum level of transfer of advanced defense technologies. We are indeed proud of our achievements, which go far beyond traditional buyer-seller relations. Among them are very successful licensed production in India of T-90 tanks, Su-30 MKI fighters, and other armaments and components, as well as joint ventures of BrahMos missiles and AK-203 assault rifles production. Importantly, this cooperation significantly contributes to the Indian defense capabilities and fully complies with the requirements under Make in India and Self-reliant India ( Atmanirbhar Bharat ) initiatives. We are committed to implement all our deals in a timely manner, including S-400 missile systems delivery. Our dialogue is comprehensive and forward-looking. We carry it on in the framework of the bilateral Intergovernmental Commission on military and military-technical cooperation. Our participation in dedicated international events in both countries is huge. In this sense, Russia is among the most active participants in the current Aero India 2023 exhibition taking place in Bangalore(February 13-17, 2023). - How is Russia helping India s bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC? - Our two countries maintain intense and thorough dialogue and coordination within the framework of the UN to address the challenges facing the international community, including on the issues of the UN reform. We share the point that the UNSC needs to be adapted to new realities of emerging multipolar world order with increased representation of developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Russia consistently supports India s bid for permanent membership in the expanded UNSC. The Indian non-permanent membership in the Council in 2021-2022 including its chairmanship in August 2021 and December 2022 strongly reaffirmed India s credentials. We are engaged in trusted and in-depth discussions on that, keeping in mind that it should be a comprehensive process. It requires a maximum possible consensus to avoid divisions in the UN as well as over-representation of the Western countries, which already dominate in many bodies, including the UNSC.

"13 Feb, 2023",Australia accused of holding ex-US marine in inhumane conditions ,"Daniel Duggan, now an Australian citizen, has allegedly been held by Canberra for 115 days without conviction The family of detained Australian citizen and former US marine Daniel Duggan plans to petition the UN Human Rights Committee to intervene to stop his inhumane treatment, his wife, Saffrine Duggan, said in a statement on Sunday, calling the imprisonment of her fighter pilot husband an affront to Australia s rule of law. The father of six children has been held in a tiny cell in Sydney under extreme conditions without any conviction for 115 days, based on unproven charges from the United States, she said, adding that he is classified as an extreme high risk restricted inmate at the Silverware Correctional Complex despite having no criminal history. The cell measures just two by four meters, she said. Duggan was arrested in October and accused of training Chinese military pilots to land on aircraft carriers, evaluating Chinese military pilot trainees, and providing aviation services in China, all without the required authorization from the US State Department. He is alleged to have received at least A$116,000 ($81,000) in 2011 and 2012 for the training work, which took place at a flight academy in South Africa, during a period when he was still an American citizen, according to a 2017 indictment unsealed in the US in December. He relinquished his US citizenship in 2012 and became a naturalized Australian citizen. Canberra approved a US extradition request for Duggan in December. He faces another hearing next month on whether he can be extradited. Duggan maintains his innocence of all charges. Saffrine Duggan previously filed a complaint with the Australian Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Her husband s lawyer, Dennis Miralis, lamented last week that both the Australian and US governments have been reluctant to hand over documents relevant to the case on the basis of secrecy provisions, hinting that Duggan might have to launch separate legal proceedings himself. Dan strenuously rejects all charges against him as being of a political character and politically motivated, his wife said in her statement. His indictment contains half-truths, falsehoods and gross embellishments. Australia s extradition treaty with the US prohibits extradition if the charges are of a political character and requires that the offense in question be a crime in both countries.

The five BRICS nations Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa currently account for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP. Meanwhile, the China and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional security bloc, includes major powers like India in its ranks. As part of the diversification of the kingdom's foreign policy, Saudi Arabia is keen to join such international associations as the SCO and BRICS, Kozlov said on Sunday in an interview with RIA Novosti. According to the ambassador, the possibility of the Gulf nation s membership in the SCO is being actively discussed, while the idea of joining BRICS is under consideration. In general, the willingness of [our] Saudi partners to become an integrated part of these multilateral organizations, primarily the SCO, seems to have a good prospect, Kozlov said. Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that more than a dozen nations had expressed interest in entering the BRICS group. Algeria, Argentina, and Iran have reportedly asked to join BRICS, while Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay are members of its New Development Bank. Argentina's potential accession is supported by China according to several sources. Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, the UAE, Venezuela and Zimbabwe have also shown interest in becoming BRICS members.

"12 Feb, 2023","Hollywood abandoned Russia one year ago, but the country's box office has just set an all time record: How did this happen?","Film industries around the world exist independently of Hollywood, and Russian producers might just be about to strike gold Over the past year, many Western companies have left Russia. This hasn't just affected the economy, it has also altered the cultural landscape. The film industry is no exception. Without Western premieres and streaming services, the country is reconsidering its approach to the film business. Russia has many examples to look to for inspiration. In many places, national cinema retains a leading position at the box office. It is both financially successful and independent of Hollywood, in the likes of France and India, to name just two examples. Different countries have built their film industries in different ways. Some have focused on domestic audiences, while others fostered a state-supported concept aimed at both local and foreign viewers. Many have developed under strict censorship and invented a metaphorical film language that resonated with international film festival audiences. So how did these countries escape the grip of Hollywood? And how far has Russia traveled in this direction over the past year? After February 24, last year, many Western production companies closed their Russian offices and terminated contracts with local studios.ParamountPictures and Warner Bros., Netflix and Amazon Prime, Marvel and Disney all stopped releasing films in Russia or suspended access to their streaming platforms. This decision impacted both the film industry and ordinary viewers. Joint projects with Netflix have beenpausedindefinitely. The global streaming platform previously purchased Russian series like The Epidemic and The Method and planned to produce its own original content in Russian. The year s highest-grossing movies globally The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick have become unavailable in Russia. Legally, at least. Along with US motion picture companies, several West European studios also left Russia. However, within a year it became evident that they are more dependent on the Russian market than their US counterparts. One example is the French cinema company Pathéwhich announcedin early December that it would return. For the past decade, Russia has been an active part of the international film market. While in the 1990s and 2000s its cinema was primarily associated with film festivals, in the 2010s a homegrown blockbuster market emerged. Russian directors, such as Kantemir Balagov and Ilya Naishuller, took part in big-budget international movie projects. Russian movies and series found an audience. For example, The Epidemic made Netflix s most-viewed list. Political differences cast Russian cinema into a new reality. The industry will now have to revisit traditional production and distribution methods and explore how they work beyond Hollywood. Hollywood is a unique industry. Its modern movies are specifically tailored to international audiences. Their goal is to encompass the widest possible number of viewers. There are a variety of reasons and viewpoints on why Hollywood dominates the global film market. Among other factors, this is linked to a greater urban population in the US, as opposed to other countries. In the US, the domestic market proved to be so large that movies made returns at home and were then exported abroad to compete with local film industries. Such a strategy eliminates risks, since, even in case of failure, the production can't suffer a significant financial loss. Moreover, the growth of the US economy in the post-WWII era contributed to the strengthening of the film industry, especially against the background of the economic damage inflicted on Europe. However, even Hollywood hasn t been able to take over all markets. It is much less popular in countries with protectionist laws in place, such as France. The share of American movies is also smaller in regions with significant cultural differences like India, China, and Africa. Currently, China has one of the largest film industries in the world. But just a few decades ago, its cinema was largely provincial and unable to win over the hearts of local audiences. The primary reasons for the progress have been surging development and new economic and technological opportunities that allowed the Chinese film industry to directly compete with big-budget Hollywood blockbusters. In 2007, 14 of the 25 top movies at the Chinese box-office were shot in the United States. In 2019, that number dropped to 8. All remaining 17 movies were Chinese. In addition, box office receipts have grown from $800 million to $9.2 billion in ten years. The coronavirus pandemic dealt a significant blow to the industry, but over the past two years, it has almost recovered, and in 2023, will likely break previous records. Having acquired an independent position in cinematography, China has been able to dictate its own rules to Hollywood. Due to its volume, the Chinese market has become so important for Hollywood that US film companies are ready to adapt to the requirements of local partners, especially regarding movies targeted at Asian audiences. Moreover, Chinese censorship is unique because the content censored during post-production doesn t just affect the copy meant for Chinese audiences it influences the version shown to the whole world. For example, in 2020, at the insistence of the Disney office in China, the kissing scene between the main character and her beloved was cut from the movie Mulan . This decision was made so that Chinese viewers would not consider this plot twist disrespectful to the original myth of Hua Mulan. Political factors are the most common reasons behind the censorship or even the ban of Hollywood movies in China. Movies directly or indirectly referring to the three Ts Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen will definitely not be shown in China. In 2016, in order to placate Chinese audiences, the Tibetan ethnicity of one of the characters in the Marvel film Doctor Strange was changed.Commentingon the decision, screenwriter C. Robert Cargill said that following the comics to the letter would risk alienating one billion people .China doesn t just fail to recognize the independence of Tibet but denies the very existence of Tibetan identity. The failing career of actor Richard Gere, who was a friend of the Dalai Lama and an active supporter of Tibetan independence, is also linked to Chinese censorship. Moreover, Gere has long been persona non grata at the Academy Awards after he publicly criticized China's policy at the event in 1993. In 2022, Russia experienced fresh interest in Iranian cinema. Once considered exclusively a film festival phenomenon, today it s emerging into an industry that may help Russia understand its own near future. Some officials see Iran as an alternative to Hollywood. State Duma deputy Sergey Solovyovsuggestedthat in Iranian cinema, Russian audiences will find long-missed stories .In June 2022, the production of the first joint Russian-Iranian film wasannounced. The social problems of ordinary people lie at the heart of Iranian cinema. Their stories mix the everyday and the metaphorical. This intersection of social issues and symbolic film language is tied to strict state and religious censorship. Iranian artists often have to find non-trivial ways of implementing their ideas, and this applies to the movie industry as well. For example, director Jafar Panahi was sentenced to 10 years in prison for participating in anti-government protests against official election results in 2009. In addition to the imprisonment, which was reduced to house arrest, he was forbidden to make films and give interviews for a period of 20 years. But despite this, over the past 12 years Panahi managed to shoot five movies and send them to international film festivals. Three of them were created with a minimal budget and shot in one location (apartment, house, car). Making a strong political statement in regard to modern Iran, these movies are also valuable from an artistic point of view. There s a paradoxical link between censorship and the development of cinematic language. Having no chance to state things directly, the authors find ways to enrich their movies with symbols and metaphors, while trying to keep the balance between politics and capturing the interest of the audience. As an example, we can take the many movies on the subject of the Iran-Iraq war. Iranian directors manage to shoot unique war films without showing the bloodshed and violence on screen. Iranian cinema is prized all over the world. In addition to awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the Berlin Film Festival, Iranian releases have won two Academy Awards for Best foreign language film . These were two of Asghar Farhadi s movies, produced five years apart: A Separation and The Salesman . They are based on everyday subjects with universal themes. The French film industry is the oldest in the world and, based on the number of movies produced each year, the most successful in Europe. It is also known for its successful protectionist policies, a model that Russia s former Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky hasproposedto emulate. The policy is rooted in the interwar period (1918-1939). At that time, Hollywood's expansion into war-weakened European markets called into question the existence of national film industries. Due to minimal cultural, language, and economic barriers, Great Britain was hit the hardest. In France, the share of French films fell to a mere 10%. In 1928, the government approved quotas for foreign cinema. The introduction of protectionist measures coincided with the birth of ""talkies."" A year earlier, The Jazz Singer , the first sound film in the history of cinema, was released in the US. When the characters started speaking, the number of foreign movies at the French box office naturally decreased because of the language barrier. The policy fulfilled its mission and helped save French cinema. Following WWII, mutual agreements were concluded between Paris and the US, and quotas were replaced by a system of support for the local film industry. Since 1948, about 10% of the cost of each ticket has gone to the Centre National du Cinéma (CNC). These funds go into supporting domestic output, as well as building and modernizing movie theaters. Television companies, internet providers, and video producers also contribute a percentage from sales to the CNC. The amount depends on several factors such as whether the organization is state or individually owned, how large it is, and the kinds of products it sells. For example, DVD and Blu-Ray movies are taxed at 2%, while pornography is taxed at 10%. Unlike Russia, the film industry in France doesn t receive direct state funding. This is replaced by a complex system that collects and distributes taxes according to the needs of the industry. However, as film critic and Cannes Film Festival correspondent on former USSR countries Joel Chapronwrites, the money allocated by the CNC constitutes less than 10% of the total budget of the motion picture. Another 25% is provided by French television channels, which are legally required to invest in film production. According to Chapron, nearly half of all French movies are co-productions made in three, four, or even seven countries . France is one of the few places in the world where US movies make up less than half of the market. Local cinema constitutes 35%-45% of the French film market, and Hollywood makes up 45% according to 2014 statistics. Incidentally, France became the main foreign market for Russian cinema in the first half of 2022. In 2021, the war drama Persian Lessons became the highest-grossing Russian movie abroad. The protection of national interests does not interfere with French cosmopolitanism. As the birthplace of cinema, France embraces representatives of different nationalities and cultures. Thus, the Spaniard Luis Bunuel, the Austrian Michael Haneke, and the Poles Roman Polanski and Krzysztof Kieslowski shot some of their best films in French, and Argentinian-born filmmaker Gaspar Noe is considered an icon of modern French cinema. Movies came to India quite early, just a year after the Paris premiere of the Lumiere brothers' Arrival of a Train . Today, India is the world s largest producer of films. The country has many independent companies that produce movies for the local population. This is due to the large variety of languages spoken by the Indians. For most foreign viewers, Indian cinema is directly associated with Bollywood. It s indeed one of the centers of the industry but is in no way inferior to other, less popular -woods . In addition to Bollywood, there is Tollywood (Hyderabad), Kollywood (Chennai), Mollywood (films in Malayalam) and others. India even has its own Hollywood (Gujarat). Bollywood has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Among other things, this proved that the old ways of making movies aren t effective anymore. The audience isn t satisfied with a few popular actors and familiar narratives that aren t rooted in Indian culture. Critics of modern Bollywoodwarnthat the industry is losing its identity and is ignoring India s social, cultural, and political characteristics. However, in recent years, many motion picture studios have emerged in South India. Compared to the Westernized Bollywood that ignores India s regional identity, their movies are closer to the people. One example is the action movieRRRabout the fight for the independence of India. It grossed $160 million internationally and became the third highest-earning Indian movie. Local audiences prefer South Indian motion pictures. A study by the Confederation of Indian Industry showed that in 2021, 62% of total box office receipts came from films produced there. Worldwide, Indian cinema is most popular in Asian countries. The country's traditional values prioritizing family and respect for elders relate to Asian audiences. At the same time, Indian cinema is also undergoing major changes and is turning to previously taboo subjects, like same-sex relationships. Modern Indian cinema carefully and respectfully explores phenomena beyond traditional Hindu morality. Nigerian cinema is practically unknown abroad. However, the country is second only to India in the number of movies produced annually, which puts it ahead of the US. The film industry hashelpedNigeria develop the strongest economy on the African continent. Additionally, cinematography is Nigeria s second largest economic sector, after agriculture. The Nigerian film industry has been nicknamed Nollywood, by The New York Times. Many Nigerians want the term dropped, since it was thought up by an American, and theyseeit as a concealed form of imperialism. Moreover, they consider that Nollywood discredits the African identity, because it implies that Nigerian directors are inferior to Hollywood. Nearly 15 years later, the same New York Times journalistcitesboth African researchers and ordinary people, all of whom agree that Caucasians cannot fully appreciate Nollywood cinema. Its traditional themes like witchcraft don t typically resonate with Western or Asian audiences. In the 2000s, the budget of a Nigerian movie could range from $1,000 to $15,000. Sometimes filming wouldstopdue to a power outage or the threat of terrorists nearby. These movies were produced in just a few days and were immediately distributed on video. In the West, Nollywood is mainly known for outdatedspecial effects. Yet despite the low quality of these films, production was quite profitable since the meager budgets were easily compensated through the sale of VHS with more left to invest into new content. To estimate the scale of the endless stream of movies in a country where in 2020, only athird of the populationused the internet, we can take a look at the filmography of one of Nollywood s directors. Lancelot Oduwa Imasuen s IMDB.comprofilestates that he directed 112 movies. However, the director himselfsaysthat in over 20 years, he has shot somewhere between 150-200 movies. The number of annually produced flicks peaked in 2008 and since then has declined. But for the industry, this indicates growth. It is no longer possible for one person to juggle the roles of director, operator, and composer. Nigerian cinema is becoming more professional and is steadily moving away from the technical inconsistencies of the 1990s and 2000s. However, distribution is still a major challenge for Nollywood. For many years, the movies came out on DVD and VHS and were sold at local markets. Most of the copies were unlicensed. For a long time, this didn t stop the creators from making money, since the initial investments were trivial. Western distribution methods are only starting to become popular in Nigeria. In 2021, the countryhadonly 68 movie theaters with a population of over 200 million people. Some streaming platforms, including Netflix, have also become available in Africa. The number of subscribersgrowsevery year. In the 21st century, South Korean cinema stopped being a film festival phenomenon and became mainstream, even in the West. The result of this long journey was the triumphs of Bong Joon-ho s film Parasite . It received the Gold Palm Branch of the Cannes Film Festival, won several Academy Awards in key categories including Best director and ""Best film , and became an international sensation gathering enthusiastic reviews from critics and audiences alike. The South Korean boom broke out once again after the release of Squid Game on Netflix, where it quickly became the top series. Until recent times, the history of South Korean cinema was littered with failures. For many years, Korea was in a politically subordinate position, which reflected its cinematography. Cinema was a latecomer, and Japanese authorities used it for propaganda purposes. For example, only several harmless genres were allowed: costume dramas, melodramas, and propaganda films glorifying Japan. This policy didn t contribute to the development of viewers sympathies. A former civil servant, Kim Dong-ho, took many measures intended to help Korean cinema. Foreign movies were limited, and each Korean film was shown for nearly half a year. In the 1980s, Koreans weren t interested in locally produced movies, preferring American titles. However, there were several known instances where nationalistssabotagedscreenings of Hollywood films such as the erotic thriller Fatal Attraction, where they planted non-venomous snakes in the hall. A year later, when Rain Man was released, venomous snakes were used. In the 1990s, the state began actively supporting Korean cinema. This is sometimes attributed to the fact that Jurassic Park earned more in 1993 at the box office than Hyundai did selling cars. Investors received tax breaks, censorship restrictions no longer applied to directors and screenwriters, and for every foreign film shown, one Korean film had to be produced. Gradually, quotas were reduced, which resulted in protests that included many industry professionals. Renowned Korean actors shaved their heads and burned tapes with Hollywood films in front of the US embassy. Oldboy director Park Chan-wook protested at the Berlin Film Festival with a poster No Screen Quota = No Oldboy , and leading actor Choi Min-sik stopped acting for several years. From the mid-1990s to 2001, the share of domestic films at the box officegrewfrom 23% to 50%, and the number of movie theaters tripled. Some attribute this rise to the introduction of quotas. Despite the popularity of quotas in the cinematographic industry, their effectiveness is arguable: protectionist measures were introduced in 1988, but five years later the share of domestic cinema in Korea was no larger than 16%. Today, quotas continue to be applied (a Korean film is guaranteed a little over two months at the box office), but their relevance is still questionable. For many years in a row, Korean films have made up over half of the country s film market, and local audiences no longer need incentives to choose domestically-produced movies over foreign options. The early 90s brought a new generation of Korean directors. They consisted of both festival auteurs like Park Chan-wook, Hong Sang-soo, and Kim Ki-duk and mainstream film directors such as Kim Jee-woon, and Yeon Sang-ho. Fans of South Korean cinema often contrast it with Hollywood. One of theargumentsin favor of Korean movies is that the average age of the Korean audience is 10 years older than that of the American audience. Hollywood blockbusters are primarily aimed at teenagers, while the average Korean viewer is older and more demanding. 2022 was the first year when Russian-made moviesaccountedfor over half of all box office receipts with a total share of 52.1%. In comparison, at this time last year 73.36% of the content shown here was foreign. January 2023becamethe best month ever for Russian cinema and box office earnings topped 8,663 billion rubles ($118 million). This was a 61.8% increase from 2022 and improved on the 2020 record by 12.3%. This success was largely due to the release of the family blockbuster Cheburashka , whichseta record at the national box office and collected 6 billion rubles (almost twice as much as Avatar in 2009) or $80 million. Currently, there are several movies in post-production that may not break the record but will likely be successful. For example, The Challenge is set to be released in cinemas this April. This is the first feature film to be partially shot in space on the ISS. The absence of Hollywood is already balanced by the development of domestic drama. By the end of 2022, the number of Russian films and TV series that went into productionincreasedby 16%. This growth has been prompted by the withdrawal of Hollywood blockbusters, which accounted for a major share of box office receipts. If Hollywood does decide to return, it will probably face much fiercer competition than before.

"7 Feb, 2023",Top EU diplomat can t hide his racist worldview Lavrov,"While criticizing Moscow, Josep Borrell predictably insulted Africa, Russia s foreign minister said Dismissing African countries as easy to manipulate is 'on brand' for Josep Borrell, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on Tuesday. He was responding to the EU foreign policy chief s accusations that Moscow was spreading misinformation. Borrell had addressed EU diplomats earlier in the day, claiming Russia was using information manipulation and interference as weapons of war. Noting that Lavrov was visiting Mali and Eritrea, Borrell called them easy countries for Moscow to spread lies about who is guilty for what is happening in Ukraine. So speaks a man who can t hide the racist essence of his worldview, Lavrov said when asked about his EU counterpart s accusations. Not so long ago heopenly spokeabout Europe being a garden surrounded by a jungle that threatens it, so the garden needs to be careful with the jungle. That says it all about who actually relates to the needs and interests of African countries, and how. We have nothing to hide or to be ashamed of, the Russian foreign minister added. We were at the source of Africa s liberation from the colonial yoke. The Soviet Union was one of the main initiators of the declaration to grant independence to colonized countries and peoples in 1960. And it was not an imitation, as [former UK PM] Boris Johnson recently called the Minsk agreements, but a real historical act that sealed the end of colonial rule. Speaking to EU diplomats, Borrell lamented that some African countries do not support the bloc s position that Ukraine is fighting for the values on which we are basing our understanding of the world. In his view, the current conflict is not only being fought on the battlefield with troops, but in the information space, trying to win the hearts and minds of people. For that purpose, the EU is protecting freedom of expression by banning Russian media, while providing support to independent outlets that Moscow has designated as foreign agents, he added. While accusing Russia of spreading disinformation, Borrell apparently did so himself by saying Eritrea was among the easy countries Lavrov was currently targeting. The Russian diplomat actually visited the country last month, along with Angola, Eswatini and South Africa. His current trip includes stops in Mali, Mauritania and Sudan.

"3 Feb, 2023",Dmitry Trenin: Why building a new world order is now an existential issue for Russia,"Moscow must first complete its break with the West, reform domestically and achieve victory in Ukraine Dmitry Treninis a research professor at the Higher School of Economics and a lead research fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations. He is also a member of the Russian International Affairs Council. It is important to understand that the West's proxy war against Russia is not just another slight bump in the road in our centuries-old relations, but rather a deep, protracted conflict with long-lasting consequences. The old strategy, beginning with Peter the Great, to Europeanize the country and take its place in that world, is no longer relevant. Which is more important - politics or strategy? Before answering, we need to define the terms. The former is a very broad term. It covers a wide range of meanings - from the political course to the smallest opportunistic steps of a tactical nature. Moreover, politics can refer not only to the activities of a single area, but to an infinite number of topics, such as the domestic politics of Israel, the politics of the great powers in the Pacific, or global politics in the first quarter of the 21st century. By comparison, the concept of strategy is much narrower and more defined. It has two main components - the goal the subject is aiming for, and the general path it has chosen to reach the goal. Strategy is very sensitive to circumstances and is constantly being adjusted, but the specific details of moving towards the goal belong to tactics. Unlike politics, which has its origins in civil administration and involves interaction with other forces operating in the same field. Strategy, which has its roots in military affairs, involves resistance. That is, the obligatory presence of an adversary. In the time of the Prussian military theorist Carl Clausewitz, who famously said that war is the continuation of politics by other (namely violent) means, strategy meant military strategy, which was strictly subordinate to politics as the highest category. Subsequently, the use of the word changed. Strategy increasingly came to be understood as higher politics, while politics was often understood as political tactics. With these concepts explained, we can now ask a really important question: what is the point of strategy in an era of fundamental change in the world? Of course, it is good to have a clear goal and a clear path to get there, but what if the goal turns out to be a mirage and the path to it a dead end? Or, having correctly identified the endpoint of the movement and planned the route, the strategist encounters unexpected small or large obstacles (""friction"" in Clausewitz's definition) along the way that throw him off course. Consequently, the desired objective must be realistic and the ways to achieve it must be multidimensional. It is clear to everyone that the modern world has entered a period of several crises:geopoliticalwith an acute phase of great power rivalry and the emergence of new players on the global stage,economicwith the regionalization of economics and finance,valuesincluding the inability of modern Western obsessions to become universal and the struggle between tradition and innovation within the West itself, as well as between the West and the East and South, and now the North - Russia, and so on. A major factor influencing the course and outcome of each of these crises has been the explosive growth of technology in various fields, from computer science to bioengineering. These circumstances make it extremely difficult not only to anticipate the general course of events, but even to position correctly to deal with their consequences. Therefore, when dealing with the crises of our time, it is particularly dangerous to get caught up in fantasies. It is equally reckless to drift at the mercy of the currents. So, it follows that the strategist (planner and navigator) and the politician (the pilot) must work together and in very close contact with each other. In this context, it is important for the strategist to first identify the prevailing trends in global development, thus creating a framework for setting goals. Next, they must 'fit' possible and realistic goals for their country into this framework, taking into account the available potential. Since strategy differs fundamentally from a plan in that it takes into account the actions of adversaries, the strategist must imagine the adversary's strategy and determine a path to defeat it, or at least find another path to strategic success. While the strategist looks into the distance, the politician must observe issues in the here and now. Situations are constantly changing, and in crises, especially when there are several at once, they move rapidly and often unexpectedly. The politician makes sure that the balance of power - especially in his own country - remains favorable to the chosen strategy. After all, setting goals is always the prerogative of the government of the day. A change of personnel usually means a reconsideration, or at least an adjustment of goals and, consequently, of the means to achieve them. The politician is also obliged to keep a close eye on the actions of foreign actors and take them into account in the interests of the national strategy. So far, all this seems rather abstract. Let's sharpen the question. What should be Russia's strategy and policy in the current circumstances, one year after the start of the military operation in Ukraine? *** Let us begin by assessing the current situation. One effect of the conflict has already been a fundamental change in the external environment in which Russia finds itself. Its political relations with the collective West, and its allies, have become openly hostile and the armed conflict in Ukraine is a proxy war by the West against Russia. Economic relations with this part of the world have been permanently undermined and are shrinking like Mars bars. Cultural, scientific, sporting and humanitarian ties have been severely curtailed, the information war has reached maximum intensity, and the Iron Curtain in Europe has been rebuilt - this time by the West. However, Russia is not completely isolated. It maintains and develops partnerships in many areas with the world's new centers of power, and other countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This part of the world community includes most of the world's states, where the majority of the human population lives and where more than half of the global economy is concentrated. It can rightly be called a world majority with the clear understanding, of course, that this majority is not a bloc and that its members are not allies of Russia. They are guided primarily by national interests and are deeply integrated into the global economy and the Western-centric institutions that serve it, which significantly limits interaction with Moscow. The dramatic shift in the external cycle has led to profound changes within Russia. The old model of mainly exporting raw materials and importing technology no longer works. The political system, which was built on liberal American-French models and then adapted more or less successfully - in substance, not in form - to domestic traditions, is obviously in need of a profound overhaul. The quasi-ideology of pragmatism and the cult of money, which dominated the country after the collapse of the USSR, proved to be flawed and harmful. In short, the end of the historical orientation towards integration with the Western world logically requires Russia to reorient itself. But what does this mean? To which ""self""? Soviet, tsarist or otherwise? A prerequisite for Russia's long-term strategy is victory in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The most important criterion for such a victory is a state that is guaranteed not to lead to a renewed war after some time. On the contrary, a defeat - if it is hypothetically possible - could provoke a destabilization of the country, accompanied by the disintegration of Russian statehood. The stakes for Russia in the current conflict are therefore existential and fundamentally higher than those of the US and its allies. This in itself is a factor working in Russia's favor, but it certainly does not guarantee its success. The strategic goal of a post-war Russia should be its consolidation as one of the world's leading powers, which is a condition for survival and security. It requires a dynamic economy and its own technological base that is absolutely essential for real sovereignty in a 21st century world, an educated and healthy population, a society based on values shared by the majority of the people, and the principles of solidarity and justice. It must also have a political system that ensures the unity of power and is based on the principle of harmonious cooperation between the main social groups, the ideological spheres and sectoral, regional and local interests, with the resolution of conflicts on the basis of law. The path to realizing this strategic goal is mostly within the country. A key part of this journey is the formation of an elite committed to serving the state and not just itself. A critical point is the choice of the head of state, especially in the case of a change of first person. This choice is not limited to the election procedure itself; it includes the selection and training of candidates, their training in different positions and situations, as well as the rules and norms of succession to the supreme power. Local government, which should be as open as possible to citizens and capable of dealing with problems, constitutes a solid popular basis for the whole power structure. It is not even necessary to outline the main thrusts of a strategy in economics and finance, science and technology, values and culture. However, to ensure that strategic visions do not remain plans on paper, as they often do, the strategist must either be a skilled politician (the preferred option) or capable of working closely with a subordinate corps of experienced and sophisticated politicians. Again, it must be understood that strategy is a struggle - not only with circumstances, but also with very specific interests and people as its bearers. Politics is the art of gaining (and maintaining) leadership, while strategy, in the words of Alexander Suvorov, is the science of victory. Nothing adds up by itself. As far as foreign policy is concerned, Russia's strategy of moving towards the goal outlined above, i.e., the status of a major world player, implies - among many other obvious things - active participation in building a new world order that excludes domination by any one country or group of countries. This is an impossible task for Russia alone. That is why it makes sense to start peace-building efforts by developing the existing institutions and practices of non-Western countries such as the BRICS, the SCO, the EAEC and the CSTO. This is a huge and complex task that requires the coordinated efforts of many states, but it is here that the groundwork is being laid for the creation of political, economic, financial and other institutions suited to the realities of the first half of the 21st century.",https://www.rt.com/russia/570912-building-new-world-order/

"28 Jan, 2023","How I tried to prevent the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, and why I failed","No amount of truth can stop the world s most powerful war machine fueled by the lies of its president Scott Ritteris a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and author of 'Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika: Arms Control and the End of the Soviet Union.' He served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty, in General Schwarzkopf s staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998 as a UN weapons inspector. Scott Ritteris a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and author of 'Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika: Arms Control and the End of the Soviet Union.' He served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty, in General Schwarzkopf s staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998 as a UN weapons inspector. In fulfillment of his solemn,constitutionally-enshrinedobligation, the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush, on January 28, 2003, stood before the rostrum in the chambers of the United States Congress andaddressed the American people. Mr. Speaker, the President began, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished citizens and fellow citizens, every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union. This year, he intoned gravely, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead. The decisive days Bush spoke of dealt with the decision he had already made to invade Iraq, in violation of international law, for the purpose of removing the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, from power. Regime change had been the cornerstone policy of the United States toward Iraq ever since Bush 43 s father, Bush 41 (George H. W. Bush) compared Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and demanded Nuremberg-like justice for the crime of invading Kuwait. Hitler revisited, the elderBush told a crowd at a Republican fundraiser in Dallas, Texas. But remember: When Hitler s war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials. American politicians, especially presidents seeking to take their country into war, cannot simply walk away from such statements. As such, even after driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait in February 1991, Bush could not rest so long as Saddam Hussein remained in power the Middle East equivalent of Adolf Hitler had to go. The Bush 41 administration put in place UN-backed sanctions on Iraq designed to strangle the nation s economy and promote regime change from within. These sanctions were linked to Iraq s obligation to be disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction capabilities, including long-range missiles and chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs. Until Iraq was certified as being disarmed by UN weapons inspectors, the sanctions would remain in place. But as Bush s Secretary of State, James Baker, made clear, these sanctions would never be lifted until Saddam Hussein was removed from power. We are not interested, Baker said on May 20, 1991, in seeing a relaxation of sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. Despite the sanctions, Saddam Hussein outlasted the administration of Bush 41. Bush s successor, Bill Clinton, continued the policy of sanctioning Iraq, combining them with UN weapons inspections to undermine Saddam Hussein. In June 1996, the Clinton administrationused the UN weapons inspections process as a front to mount a coup against Saddam. The effort failed, but not the policy. In 1998, Clinton signed theIraqi Liberation Act, making regime change in Iraq an official policy of the United States. Saddam outlasted the Clinton administration as well. But, when it came to implementing US regime change plans in Iraq, the third time proved to be the charm Saddam s fate was sealed when Bush 41 s son, George W. Bush, was elected president in 2001. While Clinton had failed to remove Saddam Hussein from power, he did succeed in killing the UN inspection effort to oversee the disarmament of Iraq, allowing the US to continue to claim Iraq was not complying with its obligation to disarm, and therefore justify the continuation of economic sanctions. This is where the issue becomes personal. From 1991 until 1998, I served as one of the senior UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, overseeing Iraq s disarmament. It was my inspection team that the CIA tried to use, in June 1996, to help launch a coup against Saddam, and it was the continued interference of the US in the work of my inspections teams that prompted my resignation from the UN in August 1998. A few months after I departed, the Clinton administration ordered UN weapons inspectors out of Iraq before initiating a bombing campaign, Operation Desert Fox. Most of the targets bombed during Operation Desert Fox had nothing to do with weapons manufacturing, I wrote in my book,Frontier Justice, published in 2003. Ninety-seven strategic targets were struck during the seventy-two hour campaign; eighty-six were solely related to the security of Saddam Hussein palaces, military barracks, security installations, intelligence schools, and headquarters. Without exception, every one of these sites had been subjected to UNSCOM inspectors (most of these inspections had been led by me), and their activities were well-known and certified as not being related to UNSCOM. I concluded by noting that The purpose of Operation Desert Fox was clear to all familiar with these sites: Saddam Hussein, not Iraq s weapons of mass destruction, was the target. Following these air strikes, the Iraqis kicked the UN inspectors out for good. This, of course, was the goal of the US all along. Now, with a new administration in power, the US was seeking to use the uncertainty about the status of Iraq s weapons of mass destruction programs as leverage with the American people, and the world, in order to justify an invasion of Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power once and for all. By the fall of 2002, it was clear we were a nation heading for war. I took this personally and decided to take action to prevent it. I went to Congress and tried to get the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees to hold genuine hearings about Iraq. They refused. The only way to prevent the invasion was to get the inspectors back in to Iraq so they could demonstrate that the country was not a threat worthy of war, but the Iraqis were putting up so many preconditions that it just wasn t going to happen. I then decided to intervene as a private citizen. I met with Tariq Aziz, Saddam s advisor and former Foreign Minister, in South Africa, and told him I needed to speak to Iraq s National Assembly publicly, without my words being edited or vetted. That was the only way to have them let the inspectors back in. At first, Aziz said I was crazy. After two days of discussion, he agreed. I spoke to the Iraqi National Assembly. For that alone, people have accused me of treason, even though in that speech, I cut the Iraqis no slack and held them accountable for the crimes they had committed. I warned them that they were about to be invaded and that their only option was to let the inspectors back in. Having broadcast that, the Iraqi government had to deal with me. I met with the vice president, the foreign minister, the oil minister, and the president s science advisor. Five days later, they convinced Saddam Hussein to let weapons inspectors back into Iraq without preconditions. I count this as one of the highlights of my life. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Yes, UN inspectors returned, but their workwas undermined at every turn by the US, which sought to discredit their findings. Now, on that fateful evening on January 28, 2003, the President stepped forward to complete the mission to make a case for war on the basis of the threat posed by Iraq and its unaccounted-for WMD. This was not a new debate. In fact, I had been trying to debunk this sort of argument ever since the US ordered UN weapons inspectors out of Iraq in December 1998. In June 2000, at the behest of Senator John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and a critical member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,I had put my case down in writing, publishing a long article inArms Control Todaywhich was then distributed to every member of Congress. In 2001, I had made a documentary film,In Shifting Sands, in an effort to reach out to the American public about the truth regarding Iraqi WMD, the status of their disarmament, and the inadequacy of the US case for war. Nonetheless, here was the President of the United States, taking advantage of his Constitutional obligation to inform Congress, promulgating a case for war built on a foundation of lies. Almost three months ago, Bush declared, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm [note: this is after I helped convince Iraq to allow UN weapons inspectors to return without precondition]. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations and for the opinion of the world. Bush observed that Iraq had failed to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors, noting that it was up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened. Iraq had declared that it had no WMD left, and as such was in no position to show anyone where it was hiding non-existent weapons. In fact, the UN weapons inspectors, working in full cooperation with the Iraqi government, had debunked the intelligence provided by the US alleging Iraqi non-compliance. The US was operating on principles dating back to James Baker s May 1991 declaration that sanctions would not be lifted until Saddam Hussein was removed from power. The President went on to articulate specific claims about unaccounted-for anthrax and botulinum toxin biological agents. He made similar claims about Sarin, mustard and VX chemical weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb, the President said. This was true  I was one of the inspectors at the center of tracking down Iraq s nuclear weapons ambition. But then the President went on to utter 16 words that would go down in infamy: The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. CIA Director George Tenet was latercompelled to admit before Congressthat [t]hese 16 words should never have been included in the text written for the president. As Tenet later noted, while the assertion regarding the existence of British intelligence was correct, the CIA itself did not have confidence in the report. This [the existence of British intelligence] did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches, Tenet said, and the CIA should have ensured that it was removed. The fact of the matter is that the entire case made by President Bush about Iraq was a lie, and the CIA was complicit in helping the President promulgate that lie. The sole purpose of this lie was to engender fear among Congress and the American people that Iraq, and especially its leader, Saddam Hussein, was a threat worthy of war. Year after year, Bush intoned, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, Bush said, answering his own question, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate or attack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own. Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power, to make sure that that day never comes. The President then got down to the crux of his presentation on Iraq. The United States will ask the UN Security Council to convene on February the 5th [2003] to consider the facts of Iraq s ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State [Colin] Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraq s illegal weapons programs, its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors and its links to terrorist groups. The President stared into the camera, addressing the American people directly. We will consult, he said, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. I stared back at the television screen, sick to my stomach. The President s speech was composed of lies. All lies. I had expended every ounce of my energy trying in vain to debunk these lies, but to no avail. My country was on the verge of going to war on the basis of words I knew to be false, and there was nothing more I could do to prevent it. ",https://www.rt.com/news/570612-scott-ritter-iraq-war/

The Wagner Group poses a transcontinental threat, the Treasury statement read, adding that the PMC has been involved in Kremlin-backed combat operations around the world. It referred specifically to Russia s military effort in Ukraine, as well as alleging that the group had also meddled and destabilized countries in Africa such as the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali.

"25 Jan, 2023",France agrees to withdraw from former colony,"French troops will leave Burkina Faso at the insistence of Ouagadougou The French government announced on Wednesday that its troops will leave Burkina Faso within a month, after the Burkinabe government officially repudiated a status of forces agreement from 2018. Special forces soldiers from the former colonial power had been deployed in the West African nation, as part of a mission to combat terrorism. The French Foreign Ministry formally received the demarche from Ouagadougou on Tuesday, giving France a 30-day notice to withdraw. We will respect the terms of the agreement by honoring this request, the Quai d'Orsay said in a statement. According to AFP, the troops will leave Burkina Faso by the end of February, and their equipment will follow by late April. An estimated 400 French troops have been in Burkina Faso for years as part of Operation Sabre, a counter-insurgency targeting jihadists in the former African colonies. Frustrated with the fruitless campaign, the Burkinabe military ousted the civilian president in a coup last January. The coup leader, French-educated Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba, was thenoverthrownby Captain Ibrahim Traore in September.

According to the Agence d Information du Burkina, the Traore government had made the decision to expel the former colonial power two days prior. France responded byseeking clarificationfrom the former colony. Burkina Faso s move comes less than six months after its neighbor Mali also sent the French troops packing.

"24 Jan, 2023",Ukraine advises West on how to negotiate with Russia,"Foreign minister claims Moscow used Minsk truce to buy time, against Franco-German evidence Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has claimed that Kiev negotiated in good faith for years, while Moscow used the Minsk process mediated by Paris and Berlin to buy time for war. He also argued the West is not enough for peace, which can only come when the Global South sides with Ukraine. For eight years, Ukraine and the West tried to end the war by means of politics and diplomacy, Kuleba argued in aPolitico op-edon Tuesday, titled How Not to Negotiate with Russia. The Minsk process, initiated in 2014 by France and Germany, saw Ukraine agree to years of fruitless negotiations in order to avoid escalation and preserve peace in Europe, he wrote. While we were holding back, Russia was building up, Kuleba said, claiming that Moscow was preparing for a full-scale war on Ukraine all along, in order to destroy the democratic international order with a single devastating blow. Ukraine fully adhered to the Minsk process, while Russia never sought fair peace and fair play, Kuleba claimed. The claims, for which Kuleba provided no evidence, contradicted the recent testimonies by German and French leaders at the time, as well as Ukraine s own former president. Former German chancellor AngelaMerkel saidlast month that the purpose of Minsk was to give Ukraine valuable time to build up its military. Former French president Francois Hollandeconfirmed thisto Ukrainian media at the end of December. Pyotr Poroshenko, who ran Ukraine between 2014 and 2019, said openlyin Junelast year that Minsk meant nothing and was a ploy to delay the war to secure eight years to restore economic growth and create powerful armed forces. In Kuleba s Politico history, none of this happened. Instead, the Ukrainian foreign minister claimed that deception lies at the core of Russia s foreign policy and the way it treats international partners — both in Europe, Africa, Asia and other regions and that Moscow prefers to talk with victims, weaklings, henchmen. On Monday, former Russian president DmitryMedvedev warnedMoscow s diplomats that the West was trying to enlist as many votes as possible in support of their anti-Russian initiatives, using underhanded means such as economic pressure, extortion and political bribery. In Tuesday s editorial, Kuleba claimed that the voice of the West is not enough to restore global security, and that peace in Ukraine now hinged on the countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America stepping up and using their weight and influence at places like the UN, where their votes counted.

"23 Jan, 2023","Yevgeny Prigozhin: The Americans fear my Wagner organization, because they know we can kick their asses","The founder of the Russian PMC replies to a US decision to include his company in a list of transnational criminal organizations ByYevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Wagner PMC The formal inclusion of the Wagner PMC by the US government on its list of transnational criminal organizations took place just a few days after the organization experienced success on the battlefield in Soledar. This is aside from the fact that Washington has been lobbing various accusations at Wagner for several years. RT asked the private military company s founder Yevgeny Prigozhin what he thinks explains these latest moves from the US. Here is his reply: Good is always fighting evil in this world. The Wagner PMC is a force. It s part of Russian power. And this power is always on the side of good. Of course if we philosophize, then for some the Wagner PMC is good, and for others it s evil. But it is evil for our enemies. America and Russia are sworn enemies, and this is an established fact, whatever your views. The Americans want to break Russia up into small pieces, and then take on China and its other rivals, in order to remain the largest and most powerful country on earth. This is all part of the debate over whether we will have a multipolar or a unipolar world. And so far the US has been doing a very good job of that. Take the USSR as an example. The Wagner PMC has not committed any crimes. Others spend their days trying to pin various crimes on us in different parts of the world. But, unlike America s paramilitary forces, the Wagner PMC eliminates only enemies of peace and commits no crimes. Of course, if you employ double standards, you can dig up dirt on anyone. But then we should ask these questions: Who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki without any consequences for themselves? Who arranged wars and revolutions in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Mozambique, Central Africa, and so on? Some of these countries later turned to the Wagner PMC, which put an end to these wars with an iron fist. So if we consider the Wagner PMC a criminal organization, then the US is a powerful crime syndicate, which lives on the money of the whole world. Accordingly, compared to this crime syndicate, the Wagner PMC is more like the vice police. I know many secrets that are very upsetting for the Americans. I have witnesses who remember how CIA officials trained Osama Bin Laden and brought bags of money and weapons to ISIS in Syria and other countries. They were preparing outlaws and terrorists all over the world so that there would be trouble everywhere in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America. It was only supposed to be peaceful on the dreamy blue island called the United States. Most world powers try not to clash with America. Those regimes that do fight back are usually declared anti-democratic, then criminal, and then terrorist. PMC Wagner is not a country or a regime; rather it is a young and unbridled force, which is why it s so feared by the Americans. They tried to destroy this force at Deir ez-Zor [Syria] in 2018, but it has recovered its spirit and is able to look into the eyes of the personification of global evil without fear. It is very important to note that we have never behaved aggressively towards the Americans, but, nevertheless, we have not accepted rudeness from them. On more than one occasion, we have caught armed groups and American intelligence officers who tried to harm the Wagner PMC and organized assassination attempts. Each time we kicked their asses and let them go in peace (there is plenty of video footage), and, before sending them home, we fed them lunch and dinner. That s why the Americans are perplexed: we don't touch them, but we also don't let them push us around. That's why they are so upset. We don t want what's theirs, but we won't give up what's ours. Oh, man, you really hit a nerve. I think I've answered in full. ",https://www.rt.com/news/570374-yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-and-us/

"21 Jan, 2023",Elon Musk fortifies father s house over kidnap fears,"The billionaire spent big to keep his family safe after multiple break-ins Retired engineer Errol Musk s home in the Western Cape of South Africa has been treated to an expensive security makeover, courtesy of his billionaire son Elon, who has expressed growing concerns about potential attacks on his family. The 76-year-old patriarch described the first-class security system and the rationale behind it to The Sun on Saturday. The younger Musk decided, after the recent threats against him, that I need protection as well, Errol told the British outlet, admitting if they kidnap one of us, it will be the quickest $20 million anybody s ever made in their life. I m really afraid that something might happen to Elon, even though he has about 100 security guards around him, Errol confessed, describing his son as a bit naïve about the enemies he s making, especially with the Twitter Files. Errol described how Elon s people last month sent in a high-end security company to completely secure the house. Some $15,000 later, the Musk compound is outfitted with an electric fence, nine cameras rolling 24/7 that can be monitored from Musk s phone, and around-the-clock monitoring by guards who are armed to the teeth. While the elder Musk admitted he didn t really enjoy the high-security lifestyle, he understood the need for it, revealing his home had been broken into four times in the last year alone. While the intruders in those cases were only after his TVs, the risk of something bad happening or literally even being shot is quite significant, he said. It s not that hard to kill me if somebody wanted to, so hopefully they don t. Errol shot three armed home invaders in 1998 when Elon was still a child. Since Elon Musk became CEO of Twitter, about 80% of the company s employees have either been fired or left. He has also leaked thousands of internal messages detailing the platforms collusion with multiple US government agencies to censor narratives they considered undesirable, from the Hunter Biden laptop from hell to skepticism about the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. Concerned about the enemies he is making, he suspended a Twitter account that tracked his private jet, accusing the user of posting assassination coordinates.

"21 Jan, 2023",China stocks up on Russian gold,"Imports of the precious metal surged over 60% last year China stepped up imports of gold from Russia in 2022, data released by the country s customs agency on Saturday showed. Last year, China bought a total of 6.6 tons of Russian gold, worth a record $386.9 million, including shipments in both unprocessed (3.7 tons) and semi-processed form (2.9 tons). In December alone, gold shipments from Russia to China totaled 220.2 kilograms, worth $14.85 million. Overall, Russian gold exports to the Asian nation soared by 67.3% in physical terms and by 63.3% in monetary terms from 2021. However, so far Russia s share in Chinese gold purchases remains small. The main supplier of gold to China is Switzerland, with sales in 2021 totaling over $34 billion. Rounding out the top five suppliers to China are Canada, South Africa, Australia, and Hong Kong. Russian gold exports began to fall under Western sanctions in mid-2022. The EU, UK, US, Japan, and Canada banned the purchase, import or transfer, directly or indirectly, of gold originating in Russia and exported from the country. Prior to sanctions, the UK was the largest buyer of Russian gold, having acquired 266.1 tons of the metal (88% of total exports), worth $15.4 billion, in 2021.

"20 Jan, 2023",US sanctions on Chinese solar panels cripple its own green agenda and harm Americans,"Thanks to political games and the fossil fuel lobby, Washington is shooting itself in the foot on clean energy Bradley Blankenshipis an American journalist, columnist and political commentator. He has a syndicated column at CGTN and is a freelance reporter for international news agencies including Xinhua News Agency. Bradley Blankenshipis an American journalist, columnist and political commentator. He has a syndicated column at CGTN and is a freelance reporter for international news agencies including Xinhua News Agency. According to a recent South China Morning Postreportciting the China Silicon Industry Association, last month, major Chinese solar panel makers Longi Green, TCL Zhonghuan, and Tongwei sliced their prices by as much as 27% on the back of cuts in raw material costs. This is set to benefit the world and mainly Europe, as the continent diversifies its energy portfolio amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and attendant disruptions of the gas supply from Russia. China is a world leader in solar panel production. It supplies more than 80% of the world s photovoltaic panels, according to information from the International Energy Agency. In its 14th five-year plan period from 2021 to 2025, Beijing is expected to add at least 570 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar power ahead of its carbon neutrality goal set for 2060. It is expected at that time that non-fossil fuel energy sources will account for over 80% of the country s energy portfolio. Likewise, the 27-member European Union has set a similar goal for 2050. With that, the EU plans to diversify its portfolio away from fossil fuels, and the conflict in Ukraine has accelerated such plans. Estimates suggest that the bloc added a record-shattering 41.4GW of solar power in 2022, which is 47% more than the previous year, and is projected to add another 53.6GW this year to up its total capacity to 262GW. China s lowered prices will save the EU a considerable chunk of change as it expands its green energy transition, given the fact that the bloc imports around 50% of its panels from China. The SCMP cited Frank Haugwitz, founder of the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory, as saying that China s lower prices will also spur fresh demand, not only in Europe but also in other important markets across Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But there s one key country that won t benefit from China s world-leading solar panel exports: The United States. And that s entirely because of sanctions that Washington imposed on Chinese solar panels and the outright ban on solar energy components from China s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over forced labor allegations. The US has yet to provide one shred of concrete evidence to back up its human rights scare campaign in Xinjiang and the majority of the international community, including every major Muslim country, hasn t bought into it. So unprovable are these allegations that the US State Department s own attorneys have cast doubt that any legal action against China over genocide allegations rattled off by some US officials would even be possible. In effect, the US is stifling its own green energy development through self-imposed roadblocks, e.g., the sanctions against Chinese solar panels and polysilicon, and casting serious doubts about whether or not Washington could ever reach its own carbon neutrality goals. The US has, through these sanctions, blocked itself from major global supply chains in the solar industry and it is highly doubtful that domestic manufacturing could ever compensate for this loss. Climate change is a serious international issue that demands a robust, collective response from the global community. Each and every species on our planet is at threat due to anthropogenic climate change. Organized human life as we know it is at stake. According to a September 2021 report by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US is at particular risk from the deleterious effects of climate change due to the country s dilapidated infrastructure, and minority communities are at particular risk. Of course, the size and power of the fossil fuel lobby are immense. They are one of the kingmakers in Washington. In the 2017-18 midterm cycle, it outspent the renewable lobby13 to onein races, and is undoubtedly a significant force behind the anti-Chinese drive. As the world s leader in green tech, China is essentially the blob s main adversary as it struggles to find its footing in a world quickly moving past dirty energy supplies. The risks posed by climate change are not abstract or far-off concepts since climate change continues to spur record-breaking heat waves, deadly hurricanes, and other extreme weather events that, within the US alone, are endangering millions, have at times knocked out entire regional power grids, and are already killinghundreds yearly. Given these stakes, the US has a duty to its citizens to diversify its energy portfolio toward renewables and build protective infrastructure that can mitigate these events. Policymakers in Washington are doing their constituents a disservice by keeping up these bogus sanctions against China. Beijing s central role as a major solar panel producer cannot be denied, and China s perceived identity as a central US geopolitical adversary is irrelevant. Time is of the essence. In order for the US to promptly do its part in joining the global fight against climate change, and also secure the life and well-being of its citizens, it must lift the sanctions it has imposed on China s solar panel industry.

"19 Jan, 2023",Dmitry Trenin: 2023 will be make-or-break year for Russia,"As the West throws the whole shebang at Moscow, the world's largest country faces a moment of truth Dmitry Treninis a research professor at the Higher School of Economics and a lead research fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations. He is also a member of the Russian International Affairs Council. Predicting the course of political events during particularly volatile periods, such as the one we entered a year ago, is a thankless and meaningless endeavor. Yet in such times, there s both a need and an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the main trends shaping the world. This brief overview is an attempt to identify Russia s main course of development in the international arena and its relations with key players in the year ahead. The longer the conflict in Ukraine lasts, the more it resembles an uncompromising confrontation between Russia and US-centric Western countries. The escalation of hostilities continues to be the dominant trend. The stakes are extremely high for all sides, but for Moscow even more so than for the United States or Western Europe. For Russia, the conflict is not only a matter of external security and its place in the world, but also a matter of internal stability, including the cohesion of its political regime and the future of Russian statehood. After the partial mobilization last fall, combat operations in Ukraine began to resemble something far broader. What started out as a ""special military operation"" may well become a patriotic war. All conflicts eventually come to an end as a result of agreements. However, the above circumstances make it nearly impossible to conclude either a peace agreement or even a stable armistice similar to the Korean deal of the 1950s. The problem is that Washington s maximum concessions are a far cry from Moscow s minimal goals. The objective of the US is to exclude Russia from among the great world powers, initiate regime change in Moscow, and deprive China of an important strategic partner. Its strategy is to exhaust the Russian Army at the battlefront, shake up society, undermine people s trust in the authorities, and finally, get the Kremlin to surrender. As for Russia, it has the resources and power to get the better of these schemes and achieve its goals in such a way as to avoid another armed conflict in the future. In 2023, combat operations in Ukraine may not end, but over the next 12 months, we will see whose willpower is stronger and which side will eventually prevail. The Ukrainian conflict has so far been a proxy war between Russia and NATO. However, the growing number of Western countries joining the conflict and aiming to strategically defeat Russia may lead to a direct clash between the Armed Forces of Russia and Western military units. If this happens, the Ukrainian conflict will turn into a Russia-NATO war. Such a situation will inevitably carry a nuclear risk. This is further aggravated by the fact that, acting out of desperation, Kiev authorities may provoke the US-led military bloc to directly enter the conflict. However, even if a head-on collision is avoided, the West s overall hostility towards Russia will keep on growing. Economic relations between Russia and Western Europe, which the latter sabotaged last year despite the evident suicide of such actions, will continue deteriorating. Western European countries are continuing to isolate themselves from Russia, seeing it as a direct threat and using this ""menace"" to boost the internal cohesion of their own bloc. For over half a century, European security has been a safe haven for international diplomacy and a mantra for foreign policy. But now, the Western Europeans have dropped the pen and taken up the sword or, more precisely, artillery systems. Ukraine is currently the most significant battlefront between Russia and the West, but not the only one. The front of confrontation extends north through Belarus, Kaliningrad, and the Baltic into the Arctic, and south through Moldova, the Black Sea, Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia. Of particular importance in 2023 are Kazakhstan and Armenia, where the West is actively supporting anti-Russian nationalist powers, and Moldova and Georgia, where it s attempting to rekindle old conflicts and open a second front in addition to the Ukrainian one. In Russia-US relations, dialogue has long been replaced by a hybrid war. And Ukraine is but one direction, albeit the most noticeable, that this showdown is taking. Washington's goal is to actively demonstrate its global dominance and it's willing to take serious and risky steps to this end. Moscow is not the main opponent for Washington, but one that needs to be taken down first. US foreign policy is merciless to rivals, opponents, and allies alike, and Russia can count only on its own power to hold the Americans back. Ahead of the 2024 presidential elections in the US, political struggles are predictably set to escalate. The Republicans, who recently took control of the House of Representatives, will likely demand greater accountability for the funds allocated to Ukraine. These largesse may also be somewhat reduced. Nevertheless, most Republicans share the views of President Joe Biden's administration regarding both Ukraine and Russia, so a change in US policy in favor of Moscow remains highly unlikely. In terms of relations between Japan and Russia, cooperation established by former prime minister Shinzo Abe is being replaced with Cold War-era hostility. In contrast to Western Europe, Japan isn t willing to break off energy ties with Russia. But the revitalization of the alliance between Japan and the United States, coupled with the strengthening military-political ties between Russia and China and mounting tension on the Korean Peninsula all signal a return to the old confrontation with Russia, China, and North Korea on one side, and the United States, Japan, and South Korea on the other. In the current circumstances, Belarus remains Russia s only absolute ally. At the same time, Moscow maintains partner relations with several nations whose importance has grown significantly in recent times. These are primarily the great world powers China and India; regional players Brazil, Iran, Turkey, and South Africa; and the Persian Gulf countries primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These countries, along with dozens of others, have not joined in the Western sanctions against Russia and continue to be Moscow's partners. However, Asian, African and Latin American countries that exist within Washington s financial empire, which are increasingly called the world majority in Russia, are forced to consider the effect of secondary US sanctions. This is apparent in the case of China. The proposal of a Russian-Chinese partnership without borders demonstrates the willingness of both world powers to develop in-depth cooperation in all fields. Despite Washington s considerable efforts to use the Ukrainian conflict to sabotage China-Russia relations, economic and military ties between Beijing and Moscow are growing stronger. The promised visit of Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Russia, scheduled for the spring of 2023, is evidence of the ongoing rapprochement. At the same time, both sides are acting out of their national interests. For Russia, the United States is currently an opponent. But for China, it is only a rival and a potential opponent. This is not enough to form a military alliance between Moscow and Beijing. China naturally values its economic interests in US and European markets, and Beijing may change its mind in favor of a military alliance only if Washington becomes its enemy. For the sake of Russia alone, China is not willing to take this step. There are also issues around Russia s relations with India. Just like Beijing, New Delhi is Moscow s strategic partner. Yet with its ambitious goal of accomplishing a major economic leap in the current decade, India is particularly interested in economic and technological cooperation with the US, the EU, and Japan. Moreover, New Delhi sees Beijing as its main rival and a potential military threat: the smoldering conflict on the border between the two most populated Asian states continues to occasionally flare up. In addition to BRICS and SCO membership, India is a member of the Quad group, which the US views as an anti-Chinese alliance. In such conditions, Russia will have to decisively strengthen its positions in India in 2023. This includes actively working with local elites, explaining Russia s foreign policy and countering the attempts to distort it by Western media (used by the Indian press as its main reference), finding and developing new opportunities for economic, technological, and scientific cooperation, and encouraging productive cooperation via international forums and other platforms. In the opposite case, a go with the flow attitude in Russian-Indian relations will result in India s drift away from Moscow. Last year, Iran became the only country to supply its own weapons systems to Russia. At the same time, Tehran entered the process of joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The North-South Transport Corridor linking Russia with the Persian Gulf nations, India, and South Asia has acquired particular importance under Western sanctions. Also, last year it finally became clear that the Iranian nuclear deal would not be extended. This means the suspension and possibly even the termination of over half a century of cooperation between Russia and the United States on nuclear nonproliferation. In 2023, Russia and Iran will continue growing closer. On the Russian side, this will require the development of a more concise and active strategy towards the Middle Eastern state. Moscow s relations with Tehran directly influence its relations with the Arab nations and Ankara. The region is notable for having several centers of power. The policy of the Persian Gulf s Arab countries (especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) is becoming increasingly multi-vector. They are no longer focused solely on the US and are developing ties with Russia and China. In the coming year, this trend will likely continue and strengthen. Having proposed a concept for regional security in the Gulf zone back in 2019, in 2023 Moscow could step up the efforts and facilitate dialogue between Iran and its southern neighbors. 2023 is the centenary of the proclamation of the Turkish republic, and will see presidential elections. For Russia and its foreign policy, the importance of Turkey has grown dramatically in recent years. As a result of the Syrian war, the Second Karabakh War, the Ukrainian conflict, and the collapse of normal relations between Russia and Western Europe, Turkey turned into a transport, logistics, and gas hub between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic world. The Turkish opposition is determined to put an end to the 20-plus year political reign of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who intends to run for another (according to him, final) presidential term. We won t make predictions concerning the upcoming election but will only point out the trend that Turkey is transforming from a regional power into a major independent player with global ambitions. This makes Ankara an indispensable, if challenging partner for Moscow. Last but not least are Russia s relations with its immediate neighbors. This trend came to the fore in 2022 and is set to continue. Over the coming year, achieving a breakthrough and eventually, victory in Ukraine, will be Russia s main priority. Belarus will remain Russia s closest ally and partner. Meanwhile, the rise of ethnic nationalism in Kazakhstan and potential discord in relations between Moscow and Astana pose the greatest risk. Other threats may include a Moldovan attempt to cooperate with Kiev and the West on solving the Transnistria conflict; a potential renewal of hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan; another outbreak of the border dispute between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and internal destabilization issues in neighboring countries. On the other hand, under the influence of last year s gigantic geopolitical, strategic, and geo-economic shifts, it has become obvious that we need a fundamentally different level of economic and military-political cooperation within the frameworks of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), respectively. It s worth noting that in both aspects, Russia-Uzbekistan cooperation looks particularly promising. What is clear is that under the conditions of unprecedented geopolitical tension along the entire perimeter of Russia s new post-Soviet borders, Moscow will need to invest a lot more attention, understanding, and effort to reap results. This will become one of the key challenges for Russian foreign policy in 2023",https://www.rt.com/russia/570064-russias-foreign-policy-2023/
"19 Jan, 2023",ChatGPT maker outsourced work to low-paid Africans TIME,"The AI behind the promising chat bot had to be trained not to spew sexual and violent content ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that garnered widespread attention for its text generation, is partially built using the labor of poorly paid workers in Kenya, TIME magazine has reported. They were hired to read passages of explicit text and label them, so the algorithm could avoid this type of language. According to an expose published on Wednesday, developer OpenAI contracted a San Francisco-based firm called Sama, which specializes in annotating data for AI training. The work is done by humans in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where wages are lower than in developed nations. Three Sama contracts with OpenAI were signed in late 2021, worth about $200,000, TIME reported citing billing documents. Around three dozen workers in Kenya were tasked with reading graphic descriptions of acts, including sexual abuse of children, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self-harm, and incest. Their output, labeled according to the nature of the content, was used by OpenAI to train their AI to police its own language. ChatGPT generates text after learning from billions of words written by humans and available online, including inappropriate material. According to the scoop, workers in Kenya were paid a take-home wage of between $1.32 and $2 per hour depending on their position and performance. Three of them told TIME they were expected to parse through 150 and 250 passages of text, ranging in length from 100 to 1,000 words, in a nine-hour shift. Last year, TIME reported that Sama did a similar job for Facebook, assisting with the removal of content violating the platform s rules.

"18 Jan, 2023",US anti-Russia bill totally unwarranted South African FM,"The legislation targeting Moscow s alleged malign operations on the continent should be scrapped, senior diplomat has said The US should scrap its Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa bill because the legislation is at odds with international law, South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said on Wednesday. In an interview with news outlet Sputnik, Pandor stated that Washington's bill should really be killed because it s totally unwarranted. I think it s an intrusion that goes against international law, she noted, adding that South African officials have made this clear to their US counterparts. We even met with the drafter of the initial legislation and indicated the offense which we view with this particular proposed piece of legislation, she said. Pandor also vowed that South Africa would continue to advocate for that bill to be torn up and not to proceed in any form or state. She also noted that the legislation had not been approved yet and is scheduled for debate in the US Senate. The bill was first introduced to the House of Representatives in late March and was passed a month later by a huge bipartisan majority. Should the bill be signed into law, the US would have to regularly assess the scale and scope of Russia s activities in Africa that undermine Washington s objectives and interests. It would also require the US to hold accountable through sanctions or other restrictions, Russian and African governments and officials who are complicit in aiding such malign influence and activities. South Africa has already voiced concerns about the proposed legislation. In September, President Cyril Ramaphosa warned that Africans should not be punished for their historic non-aligned position amid the Ukraine conflict. I think it will harm Africa and marginalize the continent, he said at the time. The bill has created ripples not only in South Africa but also through neighboring nations. In August, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which incorporates 16 regional countries, said that the law would make the continent the target of unilateral and punitive measures. Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict last February, South Africa has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia, with Ramaphosa arguing in late May that the restrictions would hurt""bystander countries.

"17 Jan, 2023",EU leaves back door open for sanctioned Russian oil Bloomberg,"India is expected to refine the sanctioned crude and send it back to the bloc as diesel India may substantially boost its exports of diesel fuel to the EU, refined from Russian oil targeted by Western sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Monday. The scheme wouldn t breach the EU s regulations, but it highlights the inefficiency inherent in the sanctions policy, the report notes. The EU ban on almost all imports of Russian oil products kicks in on February 5, coinciding with the implementation of a price cap on sea-borne crude shipped from the sanctioned country. The latest Ukraine-related penalties ban Western businesses from providing services, like insurance, for Russian oil cargoes unless it s purchased at or below $60 per barrel. The ceiling is expected to be revised depending on market conditions. Until recently, Russia was the biggest external supplier of diesel to EU countries, which have been ramping up purchases ahead of the cutoff. Due to the sanctions, the global market is projected to see a great rerouting of diesel flows as new importers of Russian crude are sending fuel back to the former buyers. Analysts expect a growing risk of higher prices in the short term. Among the new buyers of sanctioned Russian oil products will reportedly be traders in Africa, Latin America and possibly Asia. The loss of Russian barrels is huge and replacing them will be a huge logistical challenge, Keshav Lohiya, founder of consultant Oilytics, told Bloomberg. But the market is pricing in less panic as markets and trade flows have proven resilient. This will be a new rerouting of diesel. India s role in supplying EU member states is reportedly significant, as the South Asian nation has turned into one of the largest importers of discounted Russian crude since last year. At the beginning of 2022, Russia s share of India s oil imports amounted to just 0.2%. By the end of last year, it had grown to nearly one million barrels per day, reaching more than 20% of the country s oil import basket. India, the world s third-biggest importer of crude oil after China and the US, remained Russia s top importer for three months in a row as of December. India, along with the US, has recently been boosting exports of diesel, the fuel pillar of the global economy, to the EU, as production levels there currently exceed domestic consumption.

"12 Jan, 2023",Russia reacts to Turkish support of Zelensky s peace plan ,"Kiev s proposal remains unacceptable to Moscow, the Foreign Ministry has said Turkiye s stated support of the so-called peace plan formulated by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky does not change the fact that Russia considers it unacceptable, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday. Zakharova was asked about remarks made by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who stated that his country backed the ten-point proposal for peace in Ukraine promoted by Kiev. It is unlikely that Ankara s support of this project would promote the search for an optimal way towards peace in Ukraine, she said, citing Russia s previous rejection of the Ukrainian formula. I don t see any sense in any additional comments on it. The peace plan was presented by Zelensky at the summit of G20 leaders in Bali, Indonesia, in November. It involves a full Russian withdrawal from territories that Kiev considers to be its own and long-term support of Ukraine by international donors. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who represented Russia at the gathering, called Zelensky s virtual address militant, Russophobic and aggressive and dismissed his ten-point agenda as unrealistic and inadequate. The Kremlin called such proposals a non-starter, insisting that if Ukraine wants peace it should take into account the new realities, referring to the four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia last fall, after Crimea did the same in 2014 following a coup in Kiev. Cavusoglu expressed Turkiye s positive stance towards Zelensky s proposition on Tuesday during a press conference in South Africa. He touted Ankara s role as a mediator between Moscow and Kiev and said his government wanted to see a resolution to the conflict the sooner the better. Zelensky floated the idea of a UN-sponsored Global Peace Summit to discuss his ideas, suggesting that it could take place in February 2023. His foreign minister, Dmitry Kuleba, stated that Russia would have to be tried by an international court before being allowed at the table.

"10 Jan, 2023",US threatening Africa over ties with Russia Pretoria,"Washington is concerned by a Russian cargo ship s visit to a naval base in South Africa, an official has told the WSJ Relations between Washington and Pretoria have become strained after a Russian cargo ship visited South Africa s largest naval base last month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The country s defense minister said the US had been pressuring African nations over any links with Moscow, according to the outlet. Washington is concerned by the support the South African Armed Forces provided to the Lady R , a senior US official told the WSJ, referring to a Russian vessel that was sanctioned in May over its alleged involvement in arms shipments for Moscow. In early December, the ship was allowed to enter Simon s Town navy base with its transponders turned off and freely move cargo there, the report claimed. There is no publicly available information on the source of the containers that were loaded onto the Lady R , the official said. The outlet cited comments made by South African Defense Minister Thandi Modise last month regarding the visit of Lady R . She declined to reveal what cargo the ship was carrying, only saying that whatever contents this vessel was getting were ordered long before Covid, which emerged in late 2019. Washington threatens Africa, not just South Africa, of having anything that is even smelling of Russia, Modise said, as quoted by the WSJ. The article noted that, under the US law, Washington can place sanctions on any entity that provides services to a black-listed ship. Darren Olivier, who heads African Defense Review consulting company, told the outlet it was plausible that the Lady R was bringing an old order of Russian ammunition to South Africa. Moscow and Pretoria agreed a shipment of 4.5 million rounds of Russian ammunition worth around $585,000 back in 2020, he said. As for what was loaded on the ship, Olivier pointed out that South Africa s defense industry does not generally produce armaments and complete systems that are used by the Russian military. However, he said Moscow could be interested in dual-use items, including guidance systems and optics for aerial drones. According to the senior US official, who spoke to the WSJ, the US embassy warned Pretoria in November that a sanctioned vessel was about to arrive in the country, but the South African authorities did not respond. The events surrounding Lady R demonstrate the difficulty of implementing sanctions on Russia for the US and its allies, the article noted. ",https://www.rt.com/news/569629-us-south-africa-modise/

The incident reportedly occurred on December 13, a day after he submitted his resignation as head of the utility in the face of political pressure, but before it was publicly known on 14 December. According to EE Business Intelligence (EEBI), de Ruyter became severely ill after drinking a cup of coffee allegedly laced with cyanide at his office in Johannesburg. De Ruyter became weak, dizzy and confused, shaking uncontrollably and vomiting copiously. He subsequently collapsed, unable to walk, EEBI said, adding that he was rushed to his doctor s rooms by his security detail, where his condition was diagnosed as cyanide poisoning, and treated accordingly. The outlet also noted that tests taken subsequently confirmed massively elevated levels of cyanide in his body. De Ruyter took over as CEO in 2020 and led a company-wide crackdown on corruption in South Africa s state power utility, which had included sabotage of infrastructure at Eskom plants, local media reported. The company provides nearly all of the electricity in the country, where blackouts have been a regular feature for over a decade. According to media reports, the outgoing CEO has also been trying to tackle alleged criminal syndicates that had been draining the state utility through the use of corrupt coal and other contracts. Eskom cannot comment further on the poisoning incident involving the group chief executive, which occurred during December 2022, as the matter is subject to police investigation, the company s head of security said in a statement. De Ruyter confirmed to Bloomberg that he had filed a complaint with the police. He will remain in office until March 31 while his replacement is identified.

"7 Jan, 2023",NASA warns of falling satellite,"The US space agency reassured the public that the chance of anyone being injured by debris was low A defunct American satellite is expected to fall out of the sky this weekend, but it most likely won t hurt anybody, the US space agency NASA revealed on Friday, stressing the odds of debris actually harming anyone were very low, at approximately 1 in 9,400. The 38-year-old, 5,400-pound (2,449 kg) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite is expected to reenter Earth s atmosphere on Sunday night around 6:40pm Eastern Time, plus or minus 17 hours, according to the Defense Department. While most of it is expected to burn up upon reentry, some parts may survive the fall. Aerospace Corp., a space-focused research and development firm, predicts a Monday morning landing for the debris, which will cross Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the western areas of North and South America. The ERBS was launched in 1984 from Space Shuttle Challenger as one of three satellites comprising the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment mission. It was released into orbit by Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. While its lifespan was only supposed to be two years, it continued to take measurements until 2005. The satellite was outfitted to measure the earth s energy budget, the balance between how much of the sun s energy the planet absorbs and how much it radiates, and to measure the amount of ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, and aerosols in the stratosphere. Its stratospheric measurement instrument, known as Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II, is credited with confirming the thinning of the ozone layer, which absorbs most of the sun s ultraviolet radiation. Neither NASA nor the Defense Department explained why the satellite fell out of orbit. While satellites occasionally collide with each other, this is supposedly rare. However, Earth s orbit is becoming increasingly crowded with thousands of private-sector satellites from Starlink and other wireless internet providers, so much so that astronomers are concerned that the amount of light they reflect may soon make it impossible to see into space and are calling for a moratorium on their launch.

"4 Jan, 2023",Ronaldo in awkward blunder at Saudi unveiling (VIDEO),"The Portuguese superstar was presented to fans at Al Nassr on Tuesday Cristiano Ronaldo made a slip of the tongue as he was presented to the media by new team Al Nassr, saying he was in South Africa rather than Saudi Arabia. Ronaldo was unveiled at a glitzy ceremony in Riyadh on Tuesday, where he dismissed claims that heading to the Saudi league was a significant decline for a man who has insisted he is still capable of playing at the very top level. But while defending his Saudi move, Ronaldo appeared to confuse where he had landed, mistakenly telling the media: It s not the end of my career to come to South Africa. Apart from the geographical mishap, Ronaldo argued that he was as motivated as ever to be joining Al Nassr on a unique deal In Europe my work is done. I won everything and played for the most important clubs in Europe. This is a new challenge, said the five-time Ballon d Or winner as he was presented at the Mrsool Park stadium. Ronaldo has moved to the Middle East after his contract at Manchester United was terminated in November as the result of an explosive interview with UK television personality Piers Morgan. The Portuguese star s two-and-a-half-year deal with Al Nassr is said to be worth up to 200 million ($212 million) a season when commercial agreements are factored in a sum believed to be a record for a footballer. I beat all the records there [in Europe]. I want to beat a few records here. This contract is unique but I m a unique player, so for me it s normal, said Ronaldo. I really don t worry about what people say. I am really, really happy to be here. I know the [Saudi] league is very competitive. Ronaldo claimed he had given his word to sign for Al Nassr despite supposedly receiving offers from elsewhere. Nobody knows this, but I had many opportunities in Europe, Brazil, Australia, America, Portugal, many clubs tried to sign me, said the forward. I gave my word to this club. I want to give a different vision of this country and football. This is why I took this opportunity. Ronaldo concluded his deal with Al Nassr amid a split with longtime super-agent Jorge Mendes, according toreportsin Portugal. The pair are said to have disagreed over the football star s decision to go ahead with his incendiary interview with Morgan, which precipitated Ronaldo s exit from Manchester United on the eve of the World Cup. Portugal s campaign in Qatar ended at the quarterfinal stage against Morocco, with Ronaldo leaving the pitch in tears and scoring just once at the tournament as he ended up being shunted to the sidelines by manager Fernando Santos. Compounding matters, generational rival Lionel Messi went on to lead Argentina to their first World Cup success in 36 years. In Riyadh on Tuesday, Ronaldo was greeted by his image adorning a multitude of billboards in the yellow and blue colors of nine-time Saudi Pro League winners Al Nassr.

"4 Jan, 2023",China setting new world energy order FT,"Beijing s cooperation with the Gulf states marks the emergence of the petroyuan, Credit Suisse told the outlet The global energy order is being reshaped as deepening energy ties between China and the Middle East signifies the rise of the petroyuan, which could challenge the petrodollar, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing Credit Suisse analyst Zoltan Pozsar. According to Pozsar, China has been boosting purchases of crude and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and some African nations using its national currency. However, President Xi Jinping s meeting with the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in December marked the birth of the petroyuan, he said in a note to clients. At the summit, the Chinese leader confirmed that Beijing is ready to make energy purchases in yuan instead of the US dollar with GCC countries. China wants to rewrite the rules of the global energy market, Pozsar said, adding that the move to de-dollarize the oil and gas trade is backed members of the BRICS alliance (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). According to the Credit Suisse analyst, the steps towards ditching the greenback in the energy trade have intensified in the wake of the sweeping sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia, one of the world s major energy producers and exporters, in response to the military operation in Ukraine. Pozsar added that dollar foreign exchange reserves were militarized in the sanctions war, making the use of the currency unsafe for major exporters and importers of oil, gas, and other commodities. Cooperation between China and the GCC may potentially involve joint exploration and production in places such as the South China Sea, as well as investment in refineries, chemicals, and plastics. Pozsar said that implementing all of these projects in the yuan would mark a massive shift in the global energy trade. He added that even if it does not replace the dollar as a reserve currency, trading in the petroyuan will nevertheless come with significant economic and financial implications for policymakers and investors.

"31 Dec, 2022",The big questions for Russian sport in 2023,"The outgoing year has been a challenging one for many of Russia s athletes, but some positive signs are on the horizon Sanctions, suspensions, being stripped of major events. Russian sport has certainly been put through the wringer in 2022. After Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine, the nation s sporting professionals have become collateral damage in the broader anti-Russian campaign which broke out. Athletes have fallen victim to politics, unable to practice their trades on the international stage despite the mantra that sport should supposedly be immune from cross-border conflicts and intragovernmental rows. The trend was precipitated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the end of February, and has led to a multitude of federations directing a frenzy of bans and bluster at Russia s sportsmen and women throughout the past ten months. But as a turbulent year draws to a close, there are signs that 2023 could bring some welcome relief for Russian sport. Why was 2022 such a difficult year? The IOC s recommendationon February 28that international federations should, wherever possible, refuse to invite Russian and Belarusian athletes to their competitions set off a chain of sanctions. The likes of football governing bodies FIFA and UEFA soon fell into line, but even in sports as diverse as canoeing and karate, Russians and Belarusians were soon forced to kick their heels on the sidelines. Perhaps the cruelest early blow came in March when Russian and Belarusian athletes were cleared to compete under neutral status at the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing,only for that decision to be reversedjust hours before the Games were due to start. IOC president Thomas Bachhas since attemptedto defend his organization s stance, claiming that sanctions are only directed at the leadership of Russia and Belarus for supposedly breaching the Olympic Truce. According to Bach, athletes themselves are subject to protective measures partly designed to shield them from hostility they would supposedly face at international events, while ensuring the integrity of competitions. Unsurprisingly, that kind of language doesn t wash with many in Russia (and others beyond). Russian officials have decried the bans as discriminatory and contrary to the IOC s own principles something which Bach himself has effectively admitted. In a scathing assessment in March, the Russian Union of Athletesdescribed the measuresas a sporting genocide against their country. It has also been noted that nothing remotely similar was applied to athletes from countries such as the US and its NATO allies whenever their governments launched foreign military escapades down the years. Who is paying the price for anti-Russian bans? Along with widespread bans, Russia has been stripped of a litany of sporting showpieces. That included the 2022 UEFA Champions League final which was set for St. Petersburg in May, and the 2023 editions of the men s and junior World Ice Hockey Championships. There are dozens of other examples. Sports federations themselves have often paid the price for depriving Russia of events. The Russian Volleyball Federationis seeking tens of millions of dollars in compensation from governing body FIVBafter losing the 2022 World Championships. Elsewhere, swimming federation World Aquatics (formerly FINA) has been hit with a big financial loss in 2022, according toreports, partly as a result of relocating major events from the Russian city of Kazan. The price has not just been financial. The absence of Russian talent at international events has deprived sports such as figure skating, gymnastics, and cross-country skiing of some their standout stars. Commenting on the level displayed at the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships, renowned coach Tatiana Tarasovasaidthe women s competition was like seeing a20-year regression without the likes of Russian Olympic champion Anna Shcherbakova in attendance. Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsinrecently arguedthat it would be impossible for world sport to develop without competitors from his homeland. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko has been among those to argue that any major titles handed out in the absence of Russian athleteswill inevitably be devalued. Will Russian athletes return to international events in 2023? There are at least signs that things could be looking up in 2023. The IOC said at a summit in Switzerlandearlier in Decemberthat officials would explore a proposal from the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete at events under its auspices. Crucially, that could mean Russian and Belarusian athletes across numerous sports being granted the chance to participate in Olympic qualifying events next year, ahead of the Paris Games in 2024. Any Russian and Belarusian presence would most likely come with the caveat that athletes compete as neutrals and without their respective national symbols or anthems. Russian and Belarusian athletes may also be required to confirm that they will not make statements or gestures in support of their governments. Even competing under neutral status would, at least, be a route back to global competition. The chair of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), Susanne Lyons,confirmedthat her organization supported exploring the Asian proposal a further sign that the current state of affairs is not sustainable for the Olympic Movement. The president of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), Stanislav Pozdnyakov,has saidthat common sense is at last starting to prevail. Elsewhere, even officials at tennis showpiece Wimbledonare reportedly reconsideringtheir stance on Russian and Belarusian players, after banning them from the event in 2022. Officials at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) were said to have been surprised by the unexpected strength of the backlash they faced, which includedhefty fines from governing bodies the ATP and WTA, the stripping of rankings points, and condemnation from the likes of Novak Djokovic. Wimbledon was an outlier in the tennis world, with both the men s ATP and women s WTA tours allowing Russians and Belarusians to continue to compete under neutral status. The French and US Opens both permitted Russians and Belarusians entry after Moscow began its military campaign, while the Australian Open will do so in January. Tennis is held up as an example by some that Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete freely at international events without the kind of security fears that the IOC has raised, signaling more hope for 2023. One federation which has fully overturned restrictions on Russian and Belarusian athletes is amateur boxing governing body the IBA, whichannouncedin October that it would allow them to return to competitions with their national flags and anthems. IBA president Umar Kremlev, who is Russian, said that there should be no discrimination based on nationality. It is the duty of all of us to keep sports and athletes away from politics. Russian and Belarusian athletes will hope more federations adopt that type of reasoning in 2023, and that the existing bans do not drag on into the new year. How can Russia weather the sanctions storm? Russian athletes may have been sidelined from myriad events, but they have not sat completely idle in 2022. After the IOC heralded a tsunami of sanctions, Russian sports federations acted rapidly to arrange a host of alternative domestic competitions. Paralympians were invited to the We are Together Sport gamesin Khanty-Mansiyskfollowing their late snub at the Beijing Games. The Soviet-era Spartakiad games were revived across numerous sports during the summer and autumn. The second stage of the Friendship Games was held in Kazanin November, focusing on swimming and diving. More specifically, the Russian Figure Skating Federation set upits own Grand Prix seriesafter stars such as Anna Shcherbakova and Kamila Valieva were banned from ISU events. That was a pattern repeated in sports such as gymnastics. Should the bans from global competitions continue into 2023, expect more of the same as Russia continues to provide high-level domestic alternatives for its athletes for as long as they are forced to miss out globally. Will Russia look east for more sporting competition in 2023? The anti-Russian sporting sanctions have intensified the debate on whether the country might be better off handing in its membership cards at various European sporting organizations and moving to their Asian counterparts. One example is football. Faced with UEFA and FIFA bans, officials at the Russian Football Union (RFU) have discussed a potential move to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), where they would presumably be more welcome. The RFU could yet consider the move, but itannounced on December 30that for the time being it would establish a working group with UEFA in an effort to find a way back to competitions for Russian teams.The RFU has set a deadline of April to draw conclusions on the issue. After the Russian men s team was deprived of the chance to reach 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar and was withdrawn from qualification for the 2024 UEFA European Championships, officials are desperate to ensure they are given the opportunity to reach the 2026 World Cup. The RFU will also hope that Russian teams at club level will be able to return for international tournaments in the 2023/24 season, having been banned from the likes of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League in the current campaign. More broadly, the Western-driven sanctions have facilitated a trend of Russia strengthening its sporting ties with allies in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), and SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) groups of nations. Russian President Vladimir Putinhas suggestedthat the SCO could set up a sports association; elsewhere, Deputy PM Chernyshenkohas notedthat the potential audience for competitions within the SCO which is the world s largest regional organization is several billion people. Just this month, Sports Minister MatytsinsaidRussia and China are planning to hold more than 600 joint sports events in 2023. The aforementioned proposal from the Olympic Council of Asia for a potential pathway for Russian athletes to return is indicative of the notion that Russia will perhaps find more friends if it looks eastwards. There are those who have urged caution, and it seems unlikely that Russia will rush to burn bridges with organizations such as UEFA, but the growing talk of an eastward pivot for Russian sport is something to look out for in 2023. What about Russia s relations with WADA? As if life wasn t complicated enough for Russian sport in 2022, the bans imposed because of the Ukraine conflict played out alongside sanctions already levied by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Indeed, talk of neutral status and suspensions was nothing new for many athletes after WADA imposed a four-year ban on Russia in late 2019 due to allegations of data tampering at a Moscow laboratory. That was the among the acts in a long-running saga which emerged after the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and was fueled by the testimony of fugitive doctor Grigory Rodchenkov. The WADA sanction was later reduced from four years to two upon appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and formally expired on December 17, 2022. WADA, however,warned in advancethat the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would not automatically be declared fully compliant upon the expiration of the ban. Instead, RUSADA will have to pass through a comprehensive review before being welcomed back into the fold, WADA chief Witold Banka has said. Russia, in turn, has initiated steps to ensure that domestic legislation is in line with WADA requirements. RUSADA chief Veronika Loginova cautioned earlier this month that full restoration with WADA could take the whole of 2023, even though she said her organization is fulfilling its duties in full compliance with international standards. Loginova has insisted thatthere are no grounds for mistrustbetween the two organizations heading into 2023. Somewhat compounding matters,RUSADA and WADA are at loggerheadsover the case of teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva. Then aged 15, Valieva won gold in the team event at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in February, but was later revealed to have returned a positive test for banned heart medicine trimetazidine based on a sample taken in December of 2021. RUSADA investigated the case but said in October that it would not disclose the findings publicly, citing Valieva s status as a minor. Angered by the time it has taken to resolve the case, WADA has filed a complaint at CAS seeking a potential four-year ban for Valieva which would also see Russia stripped of the Beijing team event gold medal it won, partly thanks to Valieva s superb performances.That issue, and the broader one of Russia returning to full compliance status with WADA, remains an important one to resolve moving into 2023. Will Russia still have success on the international stage in 2023? Despite all the bans across numerous sports, Russian athletes were still prominent at major events in 2022. In ice hockey s elite NHL, Russian winger Valeri Nichushkin was integralas the Colorado Avalanche won a first Stanley Cupin two decades. That ensured Russia has had at least one player on the roster of the NHL champions for the past seven seasons. Elsewhere, Russia s Igor Shesterkin of the New York Rangerswon the Vezina Trophyfor the NHL s best goalie last season. Dozens of Russians remain on the rosters at NHL teams and are set to be prominent as the current season develops. Not least Washington Capitals leader Alexander Ovechkin, who is pursuing the league s all-time goalscoring record,having recently overtaken Gordie Howein second place on the list. In tennis, 2022 came to an end with two Russian men s stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev inside the world s top 10. Both will be expected to challenge again at Grand Slams in the new year, while 2021 US Open champion Medvedev will be aiming torecapture his former status as world number one. In the women s game, Russia s Daria Kasatkina and Veronika Kudermetova areinside the WTA s leading ten stars, while Ekaterina Alexandrova and Luidmila Samsonovaoccupy places in the top 20. Russian-born Elena Rybakina, who has represented Kazakhstan since 2018,won the Wimbledon women s singles titlein 2022 and will hope to build on that success. In chess, governing body FIDE has continued to allow Russian players to compete under neutral status. After winning the Candidates Tournament in 2022, Russia s Ian Nepomniachtchiwill contest the world title in April 2023when he faces Ding Liren of China. Ding was named Nepomniachtch s opponent after reigning world champion Magnus Carlsendeclined the chanceto attempt to win the title for a sixth time.Combat sports continues to boast some top-level Russian talent. Islam Makhachevcaptured the UFC lightweighttitlein October following in the footsteps of friend and mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov. Makhachev s first title defense comes against Australian featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 284 in Perth in February. In boxing, Russia s Dmitry Bivol did what only one other man has ever done bydefeating Mexican great Saul Canelo Alvarezin their WBA light-heavyweight title fight in May. Bivol will again be among the top fighters to watch in 2023 as will Dagestan s Artur Beterbiev,a unified light heavyweight championwith a staggering 100% knockout rate in his 18 fights as a professional. Beterbiev faces Britain s Anthony Yarde in London in January, but beyond that a potential blockbuster unification fight against compatriot Bivol has been mooted further down the line.From chessboards to boxing rings, and tennis courts to ice hockey arenas, Russian athletes are still proving themselves at the top. They will continue to do so in 2023 even if some of their compatriots have frustratingly been forced out of action on the international stage.

"28 Dec, 2022",Russia to divert metals away from West,"The Trade Ministry names new export destinations, and says talks on supplies are underway Russia will redirect its metal exports from Western countries to alternative markets due to sanctions imposed by the EU and US, Trade Minister Denis Manturov said on Monday. Moscow named China, Turkiye, South East Asia, member states of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and CIS countries as priority areas for diversifying metal supplies. According to Manturov, trade flows will also focus on the Latin American, African and Middle Eastern markets. Speaking at a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Manturov noted that our enterprises, with the participation of trade missions, are already reorienting exports, adding that the state will provide measures of support for logistics. Russia is a major metals producer and exporter. According to Institut Polytechnique de Paris, last year the country held a 13% market share for titanium production, 11.2% for nickel, 10.5% for platinum, 5.4% for aluminum, 4% for copper and 4.4% for cobalt. It is the world s top producer of palladium, a rare metal used in car manufacturing, accounting for 37% of production in 2021. Russia is not only a major producer of primary aluminum but it is also embedded in the global supply chains needed to make the metal. Although Russian metals and the companies that produce them have not been directly targeted by Western sanctions, many buyers have shunned imports from the country. Meanwhile, China has boosted its primary aluminum purchases with Russian supplies hitting a 2022 record of 56,000 tons in November, according to Reuters.

"26 Dec, 2022",New trade route helps Russia and Iran bypass sanctions Bloomberg,"Cargo transportation between the two countries via the Caspian Sea has increased, tracking data compiled by the news outlet shows Russia and Iran are building a new transcontinental trade route and are rapidly expanding supply chains, having stepped up mutual cargo deliveries across the Caspian Sea, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing tracking data. The trade corridor that stretches from the Sea of Azov and the mouth of the Don River in Russia to Iranian hubs on the Caspian Sea and ultimately the Indian Ocean has become increasingly busy in recent months, with new routes emerging, according to the report. Ship-tracking data compiled by the news outlet showed hundreds of both Russian and Iranian vessels along rivers that lead to the Caspian Sea. Iran s geographical location allows Russia to safely transport goods via the trade corridor through Iranian territory all the way to Asia and India without incurring the risk of Western sanctions. With European transport networks getting closed off, they re focused on developing alternative trade corridors which support Russia s turn to the East. You can impose controls over sea routes, but land routes are difficult to watch. It s almost impossible to track them all, Nikolay Kozhanov, a Gulf expert at Qatar University, told Bloomberg. Trade with Iran, while significant on its own, is seen as a logistical bridge between Russia and the Middle East, as well as South and Southeast Asia, according to the head of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sergey Katyrin. At an economic forum in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin also drew attention to the need to develop the ship, rail, and road infrastructure along the route, as it will provide Russian companies with new opportunities to enter the markets of Iran, India, the Middle East and Africa, and will facilitate supplies from these countries in return. This is about establishing sanctions-proof supply chains all the way through, Maria Shagina, an expert on sanctions and Russian foreign policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the news outlet. Russia and Iran are investing some $25 billion in the expansion of the trade route, according to Shagina. Russia is also reportedly in the final stages of establishing rules that would give ships from Iran the right of passage along the inland waterways of the Volga and Don rivers, according to Iran s Maritime News Agency. Trade between Russia and Iran has surged this year, with turnover exceeding $4 billion over January-October 2022 and expected to surpass $5 billion by the end of the year, according to Russia s Federal Customs Service. Russian exports to Iran have so far jumped by 27% versus last year, while imports are up 10%. ",https://www.rt.com/business/568649-trade-route-russia-iran-sanctions/
"24 Dec, 2022",German coal consumption soars Bloomberg,"Pollution levels in the country have at times reached those of India and South Africa, the outlet reports Energy shortages and surging power prices have pushed Germany to boost coal use despite the country s commitment to fighting climate change, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. To keep the lights on, Europe s largest economy is now burning coal at the fastest pace in at least six years, despite the government s ambitions to phase out the fossil fuel. According to Bloomberg, Germany will be one of the few countries to increase coal imports next year. Facing the dilemma of whether to cut carbon emissions or guarantee energy security in the country, Germany opted for the latter and reopened a number of coal plants. The International Energy Agency said in a recent report that most countries are using a limited amount of coal power capacity and only in Germany, with 10 gigawatts, is the reversal at a significant scale. Coal consumption in the country has surged at times this month, bringing it to pollution levels comparable to those in South Africa and India, Bloomberg said, citing Electricity Maps data. According to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), the country now produces more than one third of its electricity from coal-fired plants. Power generation using coal was up 13.3% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, data shows. Coal is coming back as a baseload generator, founder and director of Perret Associates energy consultancy Guillaume Perret said, adding that the commodity will be less seasonal than it has been with more coal-burning in summer, spring and autumn, as long as coal remains so much in the money versus gas and there remains a gas shortage. While the deficit of natural gas in Germany is one reason for reviving coal, another is the growing demand in France, where power generation was disrupted by nuclear reactor outages. This year, Germany may become a net exporter of electricity to France for the first time since at least 1990, according to Destatis. It is likely that Germany will have to suspend the government s planned closure of the most polluting power plants by at least nine months and keep them operational until the end of 2024, Perret said.

"23 Dec, 2022",African gas heavyweight hopes to join BRICS next year,"As a member of the club that includes Russia and China, Algeria would undertake ambitious development projects, its president said Algeria could become part of the BRICS alliance of emerging economies as soon late 2023, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has said. The North African country applied to join the group, which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, in November. Tebboune made the prediction while talking to national media on Thursday about his government s plans for economic development. Alegeria will boost investments, improve human development and shift towards a more advanced export structure relying less on hydrocarbons, to qualify for BRICS membership, he said. Algeria is a major producer of natural gas and the biggest exporter of the fuel in the region. Partnering with BRICS would help Algeria launch ambitious joint infrastructure projects, such as a transnational railroad that would improve the nation s connection to the Sahel region, Tebboune said. BRICS was originally BRIC , a term coined by economists to describe four nations with the potential to dominate the world economy in the 21st century. The said nations formed a group in the late 2000s and soon welcomed South Africa as a new member, adding S to the abbreviation. Algeria formally applied to join it in November, months after Iran and Argentina did the same during the annual summit of the organization hosted by China in June. President Tebboune was among the guests of the event. Other nations that have shown an interest in becoming part of the club include Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and Egypt.

"22 Dec, 2022",Pele s cancer has advanced doctors,"The football legend is currently being treated at the Albert Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo Three-time World Cup winner Pele s cancer has reached an advanced stage, as confirmed by the hospital where the 82-year-old is being treated. Pele was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago, with national newspaper Folha S. Paulo reporting that he had been moved to end-of-life care due to chemotherapy for colon cancer no longer having its desired effect. This was denied by Pele s daughters, however, who claimed that their father had contracted Covid-19 and was being treated for a respiratory infection. In an update last week, the hospital claimed that Pele was on the mend and had shown improvement in the clinical status, in particular the respiratory infection. Through its latest correspondence, though, the hospital said that Pele presents cancer disease progression and requires greater care related to renal and cardiac dysfunctions. With this week s news, Pele s daughter Kely revealed on social media how our Christmas at home has been suspended. We decided with the doctors that, for various reasons, it would be better for us to stay here with all the care that this new family at Einstein gives us, she added. Pele had a tumor removed from his colon in September last year and has made regular trips to the hospital since. At frequent intervals, he has attempted to put fans minds at rest by posting messages about his health status to his Instagram account where he boasts 12.8 million followers. In his last non-promotional post on Monday, he congratulated Argentina for winning the World Cup at Qatar 2022, which he noted was what Lionel Messi s trajectory deserved. My dear friend, [Kylian] Mbappe, scoring four goals in a final. What a gift it was to watch this spectacle to the future of our sport, he added. And I couldn't fail to congratulate Morocco for the incredible campaign. It s great to see Africa shine. Congratulations Argentina! Certainly Diego [Maradona] is smiling now. Pele retired as his country s all-time leading scorer with 77 goals in 92 games, which has since been equalled by Neymar with an injury-time strike against Croatia in the quarterfinals of the World Cup before Brazil crashed out on penalties. Brazil s fans in Qatar paid tribute to Pele, as did the players with a banner that bore his name and picture shown after they beat South Korea 4-1 in the round of 16.

"19 Dec, 2022",UN chief weighs in on Security Council expansion,"Bringing in new members is a real possibility, Antonio Guterres said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters on Monday that proposals to expand the UN Security Council are seriously on the table. However, he cautioned that some Western suggestions on limiting the veto power of its members aimed at Russia will likely fail. Speaking at his last press conference of 2022, Guterres said that while the membership of the Security Council may be expanded, none of the body s five permanent members the US, UK, China, France, and Russia will likely lose its veto power, as any plan to modify this right could be blocked by any one of these nations, using the same veto. The Security Council consists of 15 members, ten of which serve two-year terms on the body and cannot veto resolutions. Formed in 1945, the Security Council can enforce sanctions, authorize military action, and refer cases for the International Criminal Court but only with the unanimous consent of the five permanent members. Russia has advocated for a more diverse Security Council for years, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arguing last year for giving more seats to developing countries in order to break the West s disproportionate hold on the body. Russia s permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, reiterated thisargumentlast week, telling the council that it can be democratized only through increasing the representation of African, Asian, and Latin American states. While neither Lavrov nor Nebenzia discussed adding more permanent members, US President Joe Biden told the UN General Assembly in September that Washington supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the council, where nations we have long supported would be given seats. Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa have all expressed interest in permanent seats on the council in recent years. Since Russia has blocked US-led attempts to condemn its military operation in Ukraine via the Security Council, Kiev has called on the council to figure out a way to remove Russia s veto power. Guterres said on Monday that while he is aware of British and French support for veto reform, he is pessimistic that the current arrangement could be seriously brought into question.

"19 Dec, 2022",The US is using Africa as a stepping stone against China,"Washington s multi-billion-dollar investment pledge only exists because African nations are needed to counter Beijing s influence ByTimur Fomenko, a political analyst Last week, the Biden administration hosted a summit of African leaders in Washington, DC. The meeting, the first of its kind in over a decade, aimed to increase US engagement on the continent with a view to countering China. The US has become increasingly anxious about Beijing s growing ties with African nations, accusing its rival of employing so-called debt traps and other expansionist policies across the region. Accordingly, Washington now claims it will invest$55 billion across the continent in the next three years, although there is no indication as to where that money will come from. The true goals of this effort are transparent, as illustrated byan AP headline that read China casts long shadow over US-Africa Leaders Summit. Washington s message is summarized as The US offers a better option to African partners. If it wasn t clear already, the US only has one thing in mind with its new-found love for Africans, and that is its own interest in countering China. Could it have cared less otherwise? Definitely not. When the US takes an interest in your country, it will always frame itself as a messenger of the greater good and a representative of your true interests. America has everything you want, everything you need, and you shouldn t trust those other bad countries that you might be dealing with, because they definitely plan to use and abuse you. There s been plenty of that on display at the China-Africa summit, even to the point that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin accused China, groundlessly,of destabilizing the region. But the truth is that there s a fundamental reason why African nations have been engaging more with China in recent decades, and that s not because China is more cunning and deceptive, but rather because America s record on the continent speaks for itself. US actions are a mix of a legacy of total negligence, foreign intervention in the form of military action or sanctions, or worse, the total depletion of African economies in the 1980s and 90s through programs led by the IMF which forced brutal neoliberal austerity regimes on many countries and severely lowered standards of living. The West also frequently accuses China of so-called debt-trap diplomacy in Africa, promulgating the claim that Beijing purposefully saddles African nations with debt in order to leverage strategic concessions from them. That s preciselywhat the IMF didacross the African continent, and such a legacy has been a historical driving factor in why China as an economic partner is now being preferred, despite the Western spleen over it, for in practice Beijing s actions completely contrast with what the Americans and Europeans have done. First of all, and what the US doesn t seem to understand, is that China and African nations share a heritage of common revolutionary and post-colonial ties. In the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Africa became the world s youngest continent, figuratively, because scores of new nations emerged rapidly as they gained independence from European empires. This changed the map of the world. Mao-era China, which was at the time also a post-colonial revolutionary state, was looked to as a source of support and solidarity during a time of Cold War turbulence. The newly independent African states had to navigate the path between the US and the USSR. Many therefore established partnerships with China through the non-aligned movement , which became a beacon for Third-Worldism , in the sense of avoiding both political blocs in the midst of the Sino-Soviet split. Mao-era China often gave political, diplomatic and military support to African revolutionary regimes. These included, for example, Robert Mugabe s Zimbabwe in the Bush War in the bid to topple the British-affiliated apartheid state of Rhodesia. China thus became a symbol of African solidarity and resistance; its worldview resonated with Africans. In the modern day, circumstances have of course changed. China is no longer the revolutionary state it was, yet its historic ties with Africa have remained and transitioned into new principles which still reflect non-alignment and global South solidarity through the lens of multipolarity. Having developed rapidly, China has promoted its engagement with Africa in light of these legacies, vowing to help African countries move forwards, but in doing so avoiding the pitfalls they had with relations with the West. While Western countries make aid conditional on the imposition of liberal democracy and neoliberal market policies, China vows to respect African sovereignty. Here s one recent clear-cut example of Washington s attitude. Going into the US-Africa forum, and despite being about to meet with him, the Biden administrationimposed sanctions on the son of the president of Zimbabwe,accusing him of corruption. Now, of course, corruption is bad if it is true. However, the manner and timing of this decision (which was deliberate) was both patronizing and insulting. It shows the US does not treat African nations as equals and does not respect their internal affairs accordingly. China would never do such a thing. In this case, America s intentions towards Africa are very clear to see. While African nations will be glad to procure more attention and more benefits from Washington, they are well aware it would be completely naive to place all their trust and faith in the US, a country which not only triggered some of their worst economic experiences, but also is only showing up because it has China in mind. Do you think if African nations never engaged with China, such a summit would even be a thing? Africa only gets a look in because the US is obsessed with confronting Beijing at all costs. It is a stepping stone, but not an end in itself. ",https://www.rt.com/news/568474-us-africa-summit-china/
"16 Dec, 2022",Date with destiny: Is this finally Messi s time for World Cup glory?,"The Argentine icon can win football s biggest prize this weekend Lionel Messi has produced his trademark magic in Qatar to lead Argentina to the brink of World Cup success. Five goals, three assists, and some moments of sheer brilliance from the Argentine captain have illuminated the tournament over the past month. Aged 35, Messi has said that this will be his World Cup swansong; the meeting with France on Sunday affords one final chance to win the only major silverware that has eluded him during his illustrious career. Messi is inarguably the best player of his generation in the famous blue and white of La Albiceleste and arguably of all-time. He is Argentina s all-time top goalscorer on 96 strikes, and their record appearance-maker with 171 caps. On Sunday, Messi is set to become the outright record holder for World Cup appearances, breaking a current tie of 25 matches with German legend Lothar Matthaus. Despite the numbers and the landmarks, Messi has so often been cast as living in the shadow of the last man to lead Argentina to the World Cup the late, great Diego Maradona. This weekend, Messi has a chance to match the feat that Maradona achieved in 1986, and to cap a 17-year international career that has been far from easy. Indeed, the long road to Sunday s showpiece at the Lusail Stadium has been a bumpy one even for a player as preternaturally gifted as Messi. First steps Messi s international career may have taken a very different path, had Spanish football bosses had their way. After Messi moved to Barcelona as a youngster and emerged as a child prodigy at their fabled La Masia academy, officialsare said to have made informal approachesto entice him to the Spanish national team. However, Messi was loyal to the country of his birth, and his future with Argentina was cemented by appearances for the U20 team in 2004. His exploits at youth level as an U20 world champion were enough to earn him a call-up to Jose Pekerman s senior team. He made his debut on August 17, 2005, in a friendly against Hungary in Budapest as a substitute but what should have been a special occasion ended in tears as Messi was sent off after just 40 seconds. Nonetheless, his fortunes improved when he made his starting debut against Peru in a World Cup qualifier, winning the penalty that secured victory for the Albiceleste. Pekerman was already describing Messi as a jewel, and on March 1, 2006, Messi scored his first goal for Argentina in a friendly against Croatia. A taste of disappointment Messi s progress continued as he was selected for the Argentina squad for the 2006 World Cup in Germany a tournament he arrived at as a Champions League winner with Barcelona, even though he had missed the final against Arsenal due to injury. Messi became the youngest player ever to represent Argentina at the tournament when he entered the action against Serbia in the group stages. Within minutes, he had provided an assist for Argentina s fourth goal and scored their sixth in a rout becoming the youngest scorer in that edition of the World Cup. Messi made his first World Cup start in the final group game against the Netherlands, which ended goalless, and again started the last-16 win against Mexico. But he didn t feature for the rest of the tournament as Pekerman snubbed him for a 4-2 penalty shootout loss to hosts Germany in the quarterfinals to disapproval from many Argentine fans and pundits. The 20-year-old Messi was already one of the best players in the world at the Copa America in 2007. Argentina were favorites in Venezuela under Pekerman s successor, Alfio Basile, and Messi scored in the quarterfinals against Peru and semifinals against Mexico. In the final, however, Argentina fell 3-0 to a second-string Brazil team and Messi experienced his first major heartbreak in national team colors an omen of things to come at the showpiece South American tournament. Barcelona tried to prevent Messi from representing Argentina at the Beijing 2008 Olympics until new manager Pep Guardiola intervened. Messi exacted some degree of revenge against Brazil as Argentina thrashed them 3-0 in the semifinal, before going on to clinch gold with a 1-0 win against Nigeria in the final. In the shadow of Maradona Messi was already a two-time Champions League winner with Barcelona and was awarded his maiden Ballon d Or in 2009, making comparisons with Maradona hard to escape. Messi had even scored a carbon copy of Maradona s famous 1986 World Cup goal when the youngster slalomed from his own half to score in a 2007 Copa Del Rey game against Getafe at Camp Nou. But until he could deliver on the highest stage for his country, many felt Messi was not ready to enter the pantheon housing such greats of the game as the man regarded as a footballing God among many of his countrymen. Somewhat ironically, Messi s next failure with Argentina would come with Maradona as his manager at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Argentina suffered their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974 against a young Germany team that outclassed them 4-0 in the quarterfinals. Messi failed to live up to expectations, unable to drag an average team to the title and leaving South Africa without scoring a single goal. Still shining for Barcelona, Messi struggled to transfer his performances to the national team, leading to accusations that he cared more about club than country. A home Copa America in 2011 even saw Messi and Argentina booed by their own fans something which would now seem inconceivable. Though he provided an assist to equalize in the quarterfinals, Argentina were ultimately eliminated by eventual Copa America winners Uruguay on penalties. Touching distance Messi finally took the bull by the horns at the World Cup in Brazil in 2014. By that stage firmly installed as captain of the Argentine team, Messi didn t arrive in the best of shape after an injury-filled season for Barca. Nonetheless, he scored four goals en route to the final against Germany, setting himself up to achieve what many felt was his destiny to end Argentina s World Cup wait. Again it was to be disappointment, as Messi failed to make his mark in the final and Mario Gotze s extra-time goal won it for Germany. One of the most enduring images of the tournament showed a gaunt Messi walking past the famous World Cup trophy on a pedestal as he collected his runners-up medal so near, and yet so far. Messi left Brazil with the Golden Ball award for the tournament s best player, but without the prize he coveted most. Groundhog Day Reunited with his former Barca boss Tata Martino, Messi led Argentina to another Copa America final in 2015. But history would repeat itself. Messi couldn t find a way through a tough Chilean defense in the final, and he was the only one to score his penalty in a 4-1 shootout defeat to the hosts. Messi faced criticism for not delivering the title, and for supposed indiscretions such as not singing the national anthem with the same kind of gusto that Maradona had done during his day. Just 12 months later, he had a chance for redemption at a Centenary edition of the Copa America in 2016 on US soil. Missing Argentina s first group game, he scored a 19-minute hat-trick when coming on as a substitute in a 5-0 win over Panama. Yet further disappointment was to follow, with Argentina enduring Groundhog Day with a 0-0 draw and penalty shootout loss to Chile in the final. The setback was too much to bear for Messi, who swiftly announced his international retirement. I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision [has been] made, he protested. It seemed as if Messi s affair with his country would remain forever unconsummated by a major title. But Messi finally felt love from the Argentine public, who campaigned for him to stay. It is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him, demanded then-President Mauricio Macri. Messi would reverse the decision and return for Argentina s Russia 2018 qualification campaign, confessing that my love for my country and this shirt is too great. Ruin in Russia Argentina faced a real risk of failing to reach the 2018 World Cup in Russia until Messi scored a hat-trick to defeat Ecuador in the South American qualification group. But when they did arrive in Russia, more World Cup disappointment awaited them. After Argentina were humbled 3-0 in the group stage by eventual finalists Croatia, the national media even held a mock funeral and a minute s silence for Jorge Sampaoli s underachievers. Messi still had something left in the tank with a goal of the tournament contender against Nigeria that granted passage to the last 16, but that was as far as Argentina would get. A 4-3 defeat by eventual winners France felt likea changing of the guard to golden boy Kylian Mbappe, with doubts over whether Messi would ever play on football s biggest international stage again. Hoodoo ended Failure in Russia was succeeded by more agony at the Copa America in 2019. An outraged Messi was hit with a ban after criticizing match officialsin the aftermath of a 2-0 defeatto hosts and eventual champions Brazil in the semifinals in Belo Horizonte. It seemed as if even a talent as prodigious as Messi s would not be enough end Argentina s wait for a major title, which was approaching three decades. The curse, however, would be broken under the management of Lionel Scaloni at the 2021 Copa America in Brazil a tournament that served to reinvigorate Messi s international career. Messi was outstanding as Argentina overcame Brazil in the final at the Maracana,winning 1-0 and breaking a 28-year hoodooduring which they had been deprived of major silverware. After losing three finals in the Copa America and one in the World Cup, this time Messi s tears were ones of joy. Qatar calling The Copa America success was a landmark moment and heralded a change of mood among Messi, national team fans, and the Argentina camp as they prepared for their 2022 World Cup campaign. Messi indicated on the eve of the tournament in Qatar that it would be his last World Cup, amping up the narrative and serving to motivate his teammates to do all they could not only for their country, but also their talisman. Even after a seismic shock against Saudi Arabia in their opening game in Qatar which ended a 36-match unbeaten run skipper Messi called for calm and urged fans to stick with Scaloni s squad. Messi was inspirational against Mexico with a textbook left-footed goal, and even though he missed a penalty against Poland, he was still prominent in a 2-0 win. Helping to propel breakout youngsters Julian Alvarez and Enzo Fernandez to starring roles, Messi scored his first World Cup knockout phase goal in a 2-1 win over Australia in the last 16. He was on target twice from the spot in a tense quarterfinal win against the Netherlands, once during the game and once in the shootout. Messi saved his best performance of the tournament so far for Croatia in the semifinals. After converting a first-half penalty, Messi conjured up a late something-out-of-nothing assist for Alvarez for Argentina s third goal, proving again that he can be football s ultimate difference-maker. With five goals, Messi heads into Sunday s final tied with French superstar Mbappe for the Golden Boot but ahead by courtesy of goal contributions. The feeling, however, is that Messi already has all the personal accolades he needs in a career in which he has been bestowed with seven Ballons d Or and a multitude of titles with Barcelona.What he and the whole of Argentina really craves is a World Cup. [I feel] a lot of happiness to be able to achieve this. To finish my World Cup career playing my last game in a final, Messi said this week. Everything I ve lived in this World Cup, what people experienced and how much the people back in Argentina are enjoying it all is very emotional. Messi s place among the greats of the game is already assured, but the lingering comparisons with Maradona and regrets over what might have been will again loom large, should Argentina fall short against France. After all the ups and downs, Messi has one last chance to answer those questions and more on Sunday, in a date with destiny in Qatar.

"14 Dec, 2022",Biden faces African resistance on anti-Russia stance media,"The US president has kicked off a summit with the continent s leaders amid frustrations over the Ukraine crisis US President Joe Biden has opened a Washington summit with nearly 50 African nations. He is pledging increased investment and aid at a time when he s also reportedly struggling to keep the continent s leaders on board with his campaign to punish and isolate Russia over the Ukraine conflict. African nations are reportedly largely ambivalent about and increasingly frustrated over Biden s efforts to rally support for Kiev and global condemnation of Russia, theWashington Postreported earlier this week. On Wednesday, Biden s administration convened the first US-Africa Leaders Summit in eight years, promising $15 billion in new investments on the continent. The event comes as the White House is working, with mixed success so far, to coax support from African nations that have been hit especially hard by the consequences of the war in Ukraine, especially a wheat shortage and a disruption in the food supply but also rising fertilizer and fuel prices, the Post said. Another media outlet, The Hill, noted that African leaders are skeptical that the US is a reliable partner. They don t see us as trusted, Cameron Hudson, an Africa expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told The Hill. They see us as kind of unreliable, and this summit is the start of the effort to try to rewrite that narrative. Ebenezer Obadare, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, speculated that the reaction of African leaders to the Ukraine conflict may have shaken US policy makers, alarming them over China and Russia s strong influence on the continent. This seems to be an overture. This seems to be born out of a realization that things aren t what they used to be. And if the United States is going to have to hold on to its allies in the region, it is going to have to do some smooching . Biden began those efforts on Wednesday, trying to convince visiting leaders that Washington sees Africa s prosperity as a top priority. He also spoke of the continent s role in addressing war and instability, among other global crises. We can t solve any of these problems without African leadership at the table, Biden said. South Africa is among the countries that have snubbed anti-Russia sanctions. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who previously suggested that NATO instigated the Ukraine crisis, urged Biden in September not to punish African nations by pressuring them to cut ties with Moscow.

"12 Dec, 2022",China s no-strings-attached partnership is a win-win arrangement for Saudi Arabia,"Beijing manages to maintain strategic partnerships with other countries despite their ongoing sectarian disputes Bradley Blankenshipis an American journalist, columnist and political commentator. He has a syndicated column at CGTN and is a freelance reporter for international news agencies including Xinhua News Agency. Bradley Blankenshipis an American journalist, columnist and political commentator. He has a syndicated column at CGTN and is a freelance reporter for international news agencies including Xinhua News Agency. Chinese President Xi Jinping began his epoch-making visitto Saudi Arabia on Thursday, as the Asian economic powerhouse seeks new inroads in the Middle East region amid increasing turmoil between Riyadh and its traditional allies in Washington. Despite the fact that the Middle Eastern country has long been a theocratic monarchy, new criticism has emerged in the West over Riyadh s spotty human rights record. China, however, is moving in without attendant criticisms that are while mostly valid more often than not fraught with boldfaced hypocrisy, given the West s proclivity for unilateral wars of aggression and trampling on its domestic population s civil liberties. In fact, China s policy of strict non-interference in the affairs of other countries has materialized in the Middle East with remarkable success. While Washington has stoked sectarian disagreements between Sunni and Shia Muslims by drawing the Gulf States and Iran into proxy conflicts, Beijing has pursued fruitful economic cooperation with both sides without protests from either side. China actually penned ahistoric, 25-year agreementwith Saudi Arabia s regional adversary, Iran, earlier this year that will include partnerships in many fields, including trade, economics, and transportation. China also early this year presenteda five-point security initiativeon achieving security and stability in the Middle East. The points of this initiative are advocating mutual respect; upholding equity and justice; achieving nuclear non-proliferation; jointly fostering collective security; and accelerating development cooperation, as stated by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. This has been warmly greeted by countries in the region and is a model for how China wants to foster security cooperation without launching unilateral wars under false pretenses, as the United States did in Iraq. But Xi s visit was mostly focused on economic cooperation. Saudi Arabia has drawn the ire of Washington in recent months after voting in favor ofcutting oil production in Octoberin the OPEC+ format despite calls from US President Joe Biden to boost production in order to bring fuel prices down, no doubt to help his party s odds in last month s midterm elections. Since then, Riyadh has shown its lack of desire to be pinned by the West and is diversifying its relations by turning eastward. In steps China. As a signatory of the Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and a key hub in linking Asia, Europe, and Africa, Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to benefit from development cooperation with China, which has been eager to invest in tangible assets and boost win-win cooperation with countries in the Global South seeking economic development. At the same time, the conditions are already there for the two sides to boost their cooperation, given that Riyadh is China s largest trading partner among Arab countries and China has been Saudi Arabia s biggest trade locale since 2013. In particular, China is a massive importer of raw materials from all over the world, which it uses to power its vast manufacturing base and Saudi oil is no exception. With that being said, the two are also closely aligned in their Green development initiatives, which, for the Saudi side, is detailed in the Kingdom s Vision 2030 . According to media reports, agreements worth a hearty $29 billion are expected to be signed by the two sides during Xi s visit. These include more than 20 initiatives and a strategic partnership agreement that will harmonize the aforementioned Vision 2030 with the BRI. The two countries will, after the outcome of this visit, thus more firmly align their long-term strategic outlooks to complement one another and will lead to more win-win cooperation for both sides. While Washington is seeing its relations with the Kingdom fall out in recent days despite Saudi Arabia being an ally of the United States for several decades, China is seeing a massive boost to its diplomatic capital in the Middle East. That is precisely because Beijing does not make political demands of its allies that directly contradict their basic self-interest, as the US has attempted to do by pulling Riyadh into its proxy conflict against Russia in Ukraine via unilateral sanctions and other means. That is to say that China s strict non-interference policy is its greatest leverage in butting the US out of the Middle East. Countries in the region know all too well the destruction that follows Washington s agenda; They have seen their sister countries maimed and destroyed by American foreign policy and many have had to house the refugees produced by these conflicts. But Beijing offers a different brand of partnership, namely one that is not dependent on one-sided political dealings or sectarian hatred but on simple self-interest. The greatest mark of China s success in the Middle East compared to Washington is the fact that it can maintain strategic partnerships with countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran that have been rife with sectarian disputes for decades. That is something that the West has not only never been able to achieve but has only ever capitalized on to suit its own political objectives in the region through divide-and-conquer tactics.

"8 Dec, 2022","Silent protests, controversial goals, and shock exits: The big World Cup talking points","There is much to unpack after the first couple of weeks in Qatar With the FIFA World Cup on a brief hiatus before the quarterfinals kick off on Friday, an opportunity has been afforded to take stock of the various narratives, scandals, and moments of magic which have grabbed the headlines over the past couple of weeks in Qatar. The tournament, thus far at least, has provided more than its fair share of shocks, stunning goals, and even the apparent downfall of one of football s most famous names. After the dust settled on the group stage and the round-of-16 matches, we break down some of the major talking points from football s biggest showpiece. Germany s One Love armband row A culture clash between ultra-conservative Islamic hosts Qatar and the swathes of visiting teams from more progressive countries across Europe and the rest of the world was always going to provoke some attention and it certainly did in the opening days of the tournament. Much of the lead-up to the World Cup was dominated by allegations of the human rights abuses of migrant workers in Qatar, as well as the treatment of LGBT individuals in a country where homosexuality remains illegal. And football, a sport which rarely meets a topical social justice cause it doesn t like, reacted in much the same way it did throughout the initial phase of the Black Lives Matter movement: by some high-profile players signaling their virtues with rainbow-colored armbands designed to show solidarity to the cause. FIFA had their own armband messages planned, and threatened sanctions for any players who displayed unauthorized apparel leading to the now-infamous image of German players holding their hands over their mouths in a team photograph ahead of their opening match against Japan, in protest at being silenced . Germany subsequently failed to advance past the group stage for the second World Cup in succession somethingwhich was met with glee among some Qataris, as they highlighted in retaliation what they saw as German moral hypocrisyrelated to how former star Mesut Ozil was treatedwhen announcing his retirement in 2018. Someobservers, meanwhile, suggested that Germany should perhaps have focused more on the football than off-the-field affairs. Shock results The aforementioned German capitulation, during which they were shocked by two late Japan goals inan opening 2-1 defeatwhich hastened their exit from Doha, wasn t the only upset to take place in the first days of the tournament. Argentina, who are among the sportsbooks picks to win the entire tournament, were stunned in their first match by a Saudi Arabia team which defied the oddsto claim a 2-1 winagainst the South American champions. There were similar sob stories in the broadsheets in Belgium after the world s second-ranked team signaled the end of their so-called Golden Generation by failing to emerge from their group after picking up just one win andsuffering a 2-0 humbling by Moroccoalong the way. Elsewhere, Australia surprised most by pipping Tunisia and Denmark to second spot in Group D, while Japan s win against Spain was also a harbinger of things to come ahead of the Spaniards shock ousting from the knockout stages by Moroccothis week. And that s before we even mention Cameroon s 1-0 win against an already-qualified Brazil in their final group-stage game. Ghana, meanwhile, scored a measure of revenge as they got to witnessa Luis Suarez-led Uruguay being eliminatedin hugely dramatic fashion more than 12 years after Suarez s handball in their World Cup clash in South Africa helped deprive Ghana of a first-ever semifinal appearance for an African team. The Uruguayans were denied a knockout spot in Qatar thanks to last-gasp drama elsewhere on the final day in Group H, where a late goal for South Korea earned them a 2-1 win over Portugal, propelling them into the last 16 at the expense of the South Americans.The final day drama in Group E where at one stage both Spain and Germany were set to go out was remarkable, as was the denouement to Group C, wherePoland pipped Mexico to a knockout spotby virtue of a marginally superior goal difference. While not necessarily shocking, this World Cup has also provided a significant helping of popcorn moments Serbia s 3-3 classic with Cameroonsprings to mind, as does South Korea s 3-2 defeat at the hands of Ghana, and the Ghanaians own 3-2 loss to Portugal. The hosts awful record There have been some abject performances in Qatar, and sadly for the hosts, they produced three of them. Indeed, Qatar s decade-long strategy to ready itself for the biggest month of its football history fell flat in terms of its own performances on the pitch. One goal scored, seven conceded. Three defeats. The worst record of a World Cup host in the history of the tournament. Still, if the goal was to popularize and modernize the sport in a nation which doesn t hold strong traditions in football, then it can probably be considered something of a success. But after spending upwards of a reported $200 billion to develop the various infrastructure (much to the chagrin of the previously mentioned human rights groups), and a 12-year strategy designed to identify and train Qatari football talent, getting a least a draw would have been nice. Money can buy a lot of things, but apparently not success at the top table of international football. The downfall of Ronaldo? Qatar is set to be a World Cup swansong for football s most famous name: Cristiano Ronaldo. But the tournament came at a strange time in the career of the presently unemployed star. He arrived in Qatar on the back of a tell-all interview with the UK s agitator-in-chief, Piers Morgan, which hastened his exit at Manchester United and likely cost him a substantial part of his legacy at a club whose fans have previously sung his name until their vocal cords gave out. But at least the crumbling of that relationship could be adequately ignored for a few weeks in the dry desert heat. Right? Well, maybe not. Ronaldo was, as the script dictated, selected for Portugal s opening matches by coach Fernando Santos but the drop-off in form which had afflicted his final days at Manchester United had transplanted to his national side, with the Portuguese great largely ineffective throughout. A dose of typical Ronaldo impetuousness when he was hooked off by Santos an hour into Portugal s group game with South Korea was enough for him to be dropped to the substitutes bench for their round-of-16 annihilation of Switzerland on Tuesday. And what was worse for him was that his replacement, the 21-year-old Goncalo Ramos,scored a hat-trick. It has been a bad few weeks for the Ronaldo brand but if therumors of a big-money contract offer from a Saudi Arabian teamare to be believed, his earning power looks set to increase in direct contrast to that of his playing abilities. Japanese VAR drama It just wouldn t be modern football if there wasn t a little drama from the VAR room. After its introduction at the World Cup in Russia four-and-a-half years ago, VAR has become the Marmite of football officiating: either you love it, or you hate it. Japan, we expect, fall into the former category after forensic analysis ofa controversial late goal in their 2-1 win against Spainappeared to show that the ball had somewhat miraculously stayed in the field of play before it was crossed for Ao Tanaka to poke home into an empty net. Spain (and the ousted Germany) will likely be more than aggrieved at the outcome of the inquest into whether or not the goal should have stood. In the end, the Spanish only have themselves to blame for their subsequent penalty shootout exit at the hands of Morocco, while the Germans problems ran much deeper than being dumped out by a moment of VAR contention. As for the neutrals? You can t buy that type of drama and rightly or wrongly many were glued to their television screens when the fate of an entire footballing nation in a four-year World Cup cycle falls upon the evidence of a CSI-style investigation. Political football If sport is essentially a vehicle for drama or scandal, this World Cup has faithfully delivered. The build-up to the event was dominated by allegations of Qatari wrongdoing, then you had the various armband rows and subsequent FIFA interjections. But it hasn t stopped there. Headlines were made on the eve of the tournament after Qatar s sudden about-face when it came toserving alcohol near or inside stadiums. Then we had the politically-charged tensions between Serbian and Swiss players spilling out onto the pitch and the sidelines, which was exacerbated by Swiss player Granit Xhaka aiming a dig as his Serbian opponents on the subs bench. Serbia, meanwhile, were placed under FIFA investigation afterhanging a flag depicting Kosovoin their dressing room prior to their defeat by Brazil. The USA also ignited a potential political firestorm when the US Soccer Federationdisplayed an Iranian flag on social mediawhich didn t feature the emblem of the Islamic Republic ahead of their group-stage fixture. Iran threatened action with FIFA against the USA, while the Americans said that the measure was taken in solidarity with the ongoing human rights protests in the country. US coach Gregg Berhalter apologized, and the correct Iranian flag was later used by US soccer s social media accounts. A single goal from Christian Pulisicsettled the match, if not the issue. Russia, absent from this World Cup following their FIFA ban, were also in focus despite not being in Qatar after Cameroon player Gael Ondoua was seen wearing bootsdepicting both the Cameroon and Russian flags. Ondoua spent many of his formative years in Russia and credits the country with being fundamental to his footballing apprenticeship. He haspledged to sell the bootsto raise money for charity in Russia in the days following the World Cup. And if Russia s football team aren t in Qatar, the country s cultural reach was apparent bythe playing of Russian folk songs Kalinka and Katyusha , which could be heard at various points throughout the tournament as played by local bands to whip up the atmosphere. Potential winners Back to the football. With just eight teams remaining, it is beginning to become clearer as to who might lift the famous trophy on December 18. The South American duo of Brazil and Argentina look to be in imperious form, the latter of whom are looking to claim world football s biggest prize as a parting gift to Lionel Messi on the occasion of his final World Cup: an accolade which would place him neck-and-neck with Diego Maradona in the country s list of immortal sports heroes. Typically, Messi hasproduced some moments of magicin Qatar, and shackling him will be key if the Netherlands stand any chance of progressing from their quarterfinal clash.Brazil s challenge, meanwhile, remains undaunted despite accusations of disrespect due to their dancing celebrations throughoutthe 4-1 drubbing of South Koreain the last 16.The Samba boys have turned on the style with some scintillating football and sensational goals not least from Richarlison while Neymar also appears to be free from injury again. Brazil face 2018 finalists Croatia in their quarterfinal, with Luka Modric and Co.looking steady if unspectacularthus far in Qatar. Defending champions France, and their talisman Kylian Mbappe, look every inch contenders once more, with the Paris Saint-Germain forwardleading the race for the Golden Booton five goals. Les Bleus face cross-channel rivals England in their last-eight clash. Even England, always the bridesmaids in situations such as this, appear in with a shout of ending their 50-year famine with a trophy afterrunning up big scorelinesagainst Iran and Senegal. Portugal certainly can t be ruled out, not least after setting the rest on notice with their demolition of the notoriously stubborn Swiss.The Portuguese quarterfinal clash with surprise package Morocco whose defense has been as tight as they come in Qatar should be intriguing, whilethe support for the North Africanshas been fervent in Qatar and far beyond.

"2 Dec, 2022",Late South Korean goal breaks Uruguayan hearts,"The FIFA World Cup in Qatar has produced yet more intense drama A sensational injury-time goal from Hwang Hee-chan gave South Korea an unlikely come-from-behind win against Portugal and ensured that they took the place of Uruguay in the knockout stages of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The South American team looked to be cruising into the last 16 with a comprehensive 2-0 win against Ghana in what was a rematch of the two teams controversial meeting at the 2010 World Cup. A pair of first-half goals from Giorgian de Arrascaeta put Uruguay in the driver s seat at the Al Janoub Stadium against Ghana in a game which was overshadowed somewhat by the narrative of Luis Suarez dramatic handball (and resulted missed penalty) 12 years ago which halted Ghana s journey in South Africa. This time around, it was the Ghanaians who fluffed their lines from the penalty spot when Jordan Ayew's tame spot-kick was scooped up by Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet. 2 - Since detailed collection began in 1966, Ghana are the only side to miss two penalties against a single opponent at the World Cup, excluding shoot-outs (in 2010 and 2022 vs Uruguay). Flashbacks.pic.twitter.com/bDdeq4TpDG It proved to be their best chance of the game. Two goals in six minutes from de Arrascaeta appeared to have all but confirmed Uruguay s place in the next round - especially with the score going their way in the other Group H fixture. But the tide would soon turn. Kim Young-Gwon's equalizer against Portugal for South Korea gave them a glimmer of hope, but it appeared as though their chance to mount a dramatic comeback had come and gone as the game ticked into injury time. That was, before an errant corner from Portugal broke into the stride of a counter-attacking Son Heung-min, who expertly slid the ball into the path of Hwang Hee-Chan who poked the ball past Diogo Costa in the Portuguese goal in the 92nd minute. The late goal meant that South Korea had jumped above Uruguay in the standings, and with Suarez s face a portrait of sheer anxiety on the sidelines his team couldn't score the single goal which would have ensured their qualification - even after several close chances and, of course, a late penalty appeal. When the smoke cleared it was Portugal who topped the group, with South Korea finishing runners-up ahead of Uruguay - with goals scored being the only statistic which divided them. Uruguay now join the likes of Belgium and Germany in calling up their travel agent to book a trip back home, and in Seoul you can be sure that the party is only just beginning. South Korea s prize for moving to last 16 will almost certainly be against Brazil if they top Group G as expected, with Portugal expected to play the winner of Friday evening's clash between Serbia and Switzerland.

"1 Dec, 2022",Suarez branded devil ahead of Ghana grudge match,"Uruguay play the Africans in Qatar on Friday 12 years after their explosive last World Cup clash Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez has refused to apologize for his infamous handball against Ghana at the 2010 World Cup, as the two nations prepare to do battle again in Qatar on Friday. Suarez was involved in one of the most contentious moments in World Cup history when he prevented a certain Ghana goal by deliberately punching the ball off the line during the dying moments of extra-time in their quarterfinal in South Africa 12 years ago. Suarez was sent off for the act, but Ghana s Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent spot kick before Uruguay went on to defeat the Africans in a penalty shootout to reach the semifinal. Suarez was hailed as a hero by his teammates and countrymen after the game for an act which has split opinion among football fans ever since. On Friday, Ghana will be eyeing revenge as they face Uruguay and Suarez in a Group H clash in Qatar with both nations in the running for a spot in the last 16. On the eve of the match, it was put to Suarez by a Ghanian journalist at a press conference that many people in the African country consider the forward to be the devil himself because of the handball. I don t apologize about that, I took the handball, but the Ghana player missed the penalty, repliedthe 35-year-old striker. I d apologize if I injured a player or took a red card for this, but I took a red card (for the handball). It wasn t my fault because I didn t miss the penalty.

"29 Nov, 2022",Chelsea star clinches crucial Senegal World Cup win,"Kalidou Koulibaly scored the crucial goal as Senegal outlasted Ecuador to move to the World Cup knockout stages Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly proved the difference as the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions squeezed past Ecuador to clinch passage to the Round of 16 for just the second time in their history at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar on Tuesday. Koulibaly, who moved to Premier League giants Chelsea from Serie A side Napoli this past summer, reacted quickest in the penalty area following a misplaced clearance from a free kick in 70th minute to power home from close range to give his side a 2-1 lead in a fiery Khalifa International Stadium in Doha. The Chelsea man s strike came after Ecuador s Moises Caicedo cancelled out a spot-kick from Watford s Ismaila Sarr, which had given the African side a one goal advantage just before half-time. Ecuador needed a draw to progress to the knockout stages but paid the price for what was a largely lackluster performance as they struggled to contain what was an energetic Senegalese display. A post shared by Football Senegal (@footballsenegal) Senegal took a deserved advantage in the dying embers of the opening half when Sarr cooly dispatched his penalty kick after he was fouled by Ecuador Piero Hincapie. The South Americans levelled the scores on 67 minutes after the outstanding Brighton midfielder Caicedo poked in a deft pass from Felix Torres before Koulibaly restored the Africans advantage just three minutes later to ensure their participation in the knockout stages. A post shared by Football Senegal (@footballsenegal) Senegal knew that a win was likely required to progress, unless the host nation Qatar were able to produce a seismic shock result against the Netherlands - which didn't come, as the Dutch eased to a comfortable 2-0 win to top the group. The one sour note for Senegal was the yellow card picked up by Everton s Idrissa Gueye which will rule him out of their next game in Qatar by suspension on the occasion of what would have been the veteran midfielder s 100th cap for his country.

"28 Nov, 2022",Russia-led free trade bloc seeks joint payment system with BRICS,"Such a move could help cut dependence on Western financial infrastructure, Izvestia reports The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) is interested in setting up a common payment system with BRICS nations, the newspaper Izvestia reported on Monday. The Russia-led free trade bloc aims to cut reliance on the Western monetary system. The EEU was founded as the Customs Union of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. It was established in 2015, and was later joined by Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. In 2016, Vietnam became a free trade partner with the EEU. The union is designed to ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital and workers between member countries. According to the report, citing the EEU s regulatory body, the plan also envisages the issuance of a single payment card within the two trade blocs. That would unite the national payment systems of its member states, including Russia s Mir, China s Union Pay, India s RuPay, Brasil s Elo and others. Vladimir Kovalyov, an adviser to the chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission, said the EEU is currently focused on establishing a joint financial market, with priority on developing a common exchange space. We ve made substantial progress and now the work is focused on such sectors as banking, insurance and the stock market, Kovalyov was quoted as saying by Izvestia. According to the official, a regulatory body for the proposed joint financial system of the EEU and BRICS would also be established as part of the new infrastructure. The EEU, which brings together countries in the post-Soviet space, has been increasingly looking for ways to deepen cooperation with the BRICS group of emerging economies. That bloc consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, accounting for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian wrote on Twitter that the vote shows the determination and seriousness of our country to develop regional, international and economic cooperation and strengthen its outlook towards Asia. He added that multilateralism is the reality of the present century. The SCO was founded in 2001 by Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. India and Pakistan became full members in 2017. Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said in September that his country could join the organization sometime next year. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters the same month that he sees Ankara joining the bloc one day as well. Moscow sees the increasing role of blocs like the SCO and BRICS an informal group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa as countermeasures against Western sanctions imposed over the Ukraine conflict. We are talking about countries that together account for 80% of the world s population. Which is why it is clear to any unbiased person that there is no such thing as an isolation of Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in July. Earlier in November, Lavrov confirmed that more than a dozen countries are eager to join BRICS, including Algeria, Argentina, and Iran. ",https://www.rt.com/news/567273-iran-signs-sco-documents/

"25 Nov, 2022",Hosts Qatar suffer early World Cup exit,"The Middle Eastern nation endured a second successive defeat on Friday Qatar have been eliminated from the FIFA World Cup after losing to Senegal in their Group A match on Friday, with the Netherlands draw with Ecuador later in the day confirming the fate of the tournament hosts. Qatar were beaten 3-1 by Senegal at the Al Thumama Stadium after a 41st-minute goal from Boulaye Dia and second-half finishes from Famara Diedhiou and Bamba Dieng. The hosts showed glimpses of a potential comeback by reducing the deficit to 2-1 through Mohammed Muntari s strike in the 78th minute Qatar s first ever goal at a World Cup but it was too little, too late as they followed theiropening day lossto Ecuador with more disappointment. After their 2-0 defeat to the Netherlands in their first game, Senegal are up and running and the continental champions became the first African nation to win a match at this year s World Cup. The Netherlands subsequent 1-1 draw with Ecuador at the Khalifa International Stadium where a third Qatar World Cup goal from Ecuadorian captain Enner Valencia canceled out an opener from Dutch winger Cody Gakpo meant Qatar stand no chance of reaching the knockout stages and become the first nation to be eliminated from this year s tournament. Qatar were not fancied by many to progress far at their home showpiece, but nonetheless they will have been disappointed by another tame showing against Senegal in which they only really roused themselves in the latter stages. The Qataris follow South Africa as the only host nations to be eliminated from a World Cup at the group stage, although the South Africans at least won one and drew one of their matches at the 2010 edition of the tournament. By contrast, Qatar sit bottom of Group A with no points from two matches, while the Dutch and Ecuador lead the way with four points, ahead of Senegal on three. Qatar will seek to salvage some pride in their final group match against the Netherlands at the Al Bayt Stadium on Tuesday, the same day as Ecuador meet Senegal.

"25 Nov, 2022",World shifting from West to East BRICS International Forum president to RT,"The trade bloc offers a new model of growth entailing equal rights and opportunities for members, Purnima Anand says EDITOR'S NOTE:This article previously erroneously referred to Purnima Anand as an official. She is the president of BRICS International Forum, an independent socio-economic political center working among BRICS nations, and not a BRICS official. The article has been amended to reflect that. The role of BRICS on the global stage is increasing every day and many countries are attracted to the economic bloc by the new solutions and stability it offers. That's according to the president of the BRICS International Forum, Purnima Anand, who spoke exclusively to RT this week. The forum headed by Anand is an independent socio-economic political center working among BRICS nations. The BRICS group of emerging economies currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The bloc accounts for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP. With Western economies in decline, many countries, even members of OPEC and OECD, are now interested in the stability that BRICS has to offer, Anand noted. In particular, she mentioned OECD member Turkiye, which is currently applying for BRICS membership. Many countries that are friendly to BRICS are joining the bloc, she said, adding So, this is [the] time when power is shifting from West to East. Anand, however, stressed that BRICS is not a competitor of the Western economy. BRICS nations cooperate and have a common perspective, because we don t want to develop another model of the Western economy and democratic process; we want a new model where all the members have equal rights and opportunities to grow together. She argued that for a long time Western powers had been using the whole planet in their interests, exploiting both the human and natural resources of other countries and continents. In the Western economic growth model, some countries are very high, while others very low and don t get an opportunity for their economic development, Anand noted. Today, the countries comprising the Eastern world understand what the West is doing and what is good for them, she said. The BRICS International Forum president emphasized that the whole world is currently in a very disturbing situation, with inflation running high and countries looking for solutions. Meanwhile, China, Russia, and India have started transitioning to using their local currencies in trade, which shows that there are alternative solutions within the BRICS bloc. Talking about Western sanctions against Russia, she said the restrictions are creating an opportunity for BRICS economies. This is very high time for BRICS partners and alliances to create good structure to understand where we are moving, what cooperation is required, and what new dimensions are developing by the participation of new members, Anand said.

"24 Nov, 2022",McGregor attacks Rogan and Khabib in latest tirade,"The Irishman has once again taken aim at his heated Russian rival this time dragging in UFC pundit Rogan Irish UFC star Conor McGregor couldn t get it done in the cage against Russian rival Khabib Nurmagomedov when they met in the culmination of their heated feud in October 2018, but has taken to Twitter to offer his latest thoughts on the fight that he lost by fourth-round submission. The showdown inside the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas came after a protracted war of words between the two lightweight superstars, with Khabib having the last word when he forced McGregor to submit after dominating large portions of the fight. The fractious nature of their rivalry continued after the final bell, when Nurmagomedov jumped from the cage to attack members of McGregor s entourage, while members of Khabib s team entered the cage to confront the Dubliner. And judging by the salvo of tweets issued by McGregor while apparently rewatching the fight overnight, it is a contest which still grates the Irishman for a variety of reasons. McGregor appeared to take particular exception to the commentary of the fight provided by Joe Rogan, as he addressed the UFC analyst s calling of the fight including explaining the motives behind one (illegal) knee strike he delivered during the bout. I call this knee strike the springbok Remember reebok? Ye well this is springbok. You ever see a springbok jump?

However, in another message McGregor appeared to change his course. ""Actually you know what I don t want to fight the smellbag,"" he wrote.

"23 Nov, 2022",Germany to end largest African mission,"Foreign Minister Baerbock was against the Bundeswehr leaving Mali, saying it would become a Russian vassal Some 1,100 German troops currently stationed in Mali will depart by May 2024, Berlin has announced. Bundeswehr soldiers have been deployed in the African country for almost a decade, as part of the UN peacekeeping operation MINUSMA, something the government in Bamako has been increasingly unhappy about. Chancellor Olaf Scholz s government will ask the Bundestag to give the deployment one last year-long extension in May 2023, in order to bring this mission to a structured end after ten years, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Tuesday. The UN has not yet received Germany s official notice that it intends to withdraw, however, and intends to continue the mission in Mali. The mission is currently assessing the impact of these withdrawals on its operations and we are already in discussions with a number of countries in order to fill any gaps, said deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. Egypt has already pulled out of MINUSMA. Sweden said its forces would leave by June 2023, while the UK and Ivory Coast announced last week that their soldiers would be leaving soon as well. Germany s scouts are mostly deployed near Gao, in the northern desert, and amount to less than a tenth out of MINUSMA s total strength of 15,000. Another 20 or so soldiers serve with UN missions in South Sudan and Western Sahara, which have not been discontinued yet. Mali invited outside help in 2013, after militants pledging allegiance to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) seized large portions of the country. Its former colonial overlord France led the way, launching Operation Barkhane that expanded to neighboring Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania, and Niger. Paris officially ended the missionearlier this month, however, amid growing discontent from former colonies. Mali hadcanceledits defense pact with France in May. Bamako hasaccused Franceof actually helping terrorists and reportedly sought help from the Russian private military company, Wagner. Berlin s decision to withdraw meant that Scholz and Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht had prevailed over Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who publicly opposed the idea. If entire regions fall into the hands of Islamists, if girls can no longer attend school or the whole of Mali becomes Russia s vassal, we will also feel the impact in Europe, she said in August, in an interview with Bild am Sonntag.

"22 Nov, 2022",Chinese Grand Prix scrapped amid Covid concerns media,"The event has been absent from the F1 schedule since 2019 China looks set to again be absent from the Formula 1 schedule next year, amid reports that the 2023 Chinese Grand Prix has been cancelled due to the country s Covid-19 restrictions, according to theBBC. There has not been a Formula 1 event in China since 2019, before the pandemic took hold, but the motorsport was due to return for what was to be the fourth race on next season s schedule on April 16. However, after deliberating on the feasibility of holding a race in China in view of the country s strict Covid policies, motorsport authorities are thought to have concluded that the race cannot proceed as planned, after being told that there would be no exemptions given to F1 drivers and staff from quarantine requirements if they were to test positive for Covid-19. The latest guidelines issued in China mandate that anyone who contracts Covid-19 must spend five days in a specially designed isolation center, and a further three days self-isolating at home or in a hotel. A post shared by FORMULA 1® (@f1) Formula 1, though, has not officially confirmed the removal of the Shanghai race from the calendar, though this formality is expected to be completed in the coming days. F1 is not expected to draft a replacement race into the schedule, meaning that there will be a four-week gap between the Australian Grand Prix on April 2 and the Azerbaijan Grand Prix later that month, on April 30. However, F1 chairman and chief executive officer Stefano Domenicali is also understood to be holding talks with the organizers of the Baku Grand Prix to move it forward by a week, though no agreement has been reached so far. It is anticipated that the Chinese Grand Prix will return in 2024, pending the removal of various Covid-19 restrictions. Further changes to the F1 schedule are expected in future. Azerbaijan s contract to hold races in Baku expires next year, but it is reported that talks are underway to extend the agreement by a further decade, despite claims that it could be dropped to make way for a Grand Prix in Kyalami, South Africa. The Russian Grand Prix was cancelled for the foreseeable future earlier this year by motorsport authorities, following the launch of Russia s military operation in Ukraine.

"20 Nov, 2022",Operation Uranus: The day Hitler s Nazis were smashed and the Soviet Union began to take the upper hand in WW2,"Berlin didn t expect Moscow s maneuver, which came at roughly the midpoint of the five-month long Battle of Stalingrad On February 2, Russia celebrates the Day of Military Honor. Exactly 80 years ago on this day, the Red Army won the bloodiest fight in human history the Battle of Stalingrad. The victory of the USSR was brought about by the successful counter-offensive operation Uranus . This feature was first published on November 20, 2022, the 80th anniversary of the beginning of that counter-offensive. Early in the morning, exactly 80 years ago, the soldiers of the 3rd Romanian Army were awakened in their cold dugouts on the right bank of the Don River by the roar of artillery hitting their positions. By lunchtime, Commander Petre Dumitrescu reported to the leadership of Army Group South that it was impossible to prevent the enemy from crossing the river. A day later, his group was shredded by massive tank strikes. Two weeks later, it practically ceased to exist. At that point, the Soviet troops of the Southwestern Front under the command of Nikolai Vatutin began their part of Operation Uranus, which resulted in the first major strategic defeat for the Axis countries the beginning of the end. For the Allies, the Battle of Stalingrad would long stand as a symbol of military fortitude and Russian military genius. What were the key mistakes of the German command? What revolutionary warfare methods did the Soviet generals employ during the Battle of Stalingrad? What non-obvious consequences did the disruption of the German offensive in southern Russia have? A decisive November The autumn of 1942 is considered the turning point in World War II. The seemingly relentless offensive of the Axis powers and their seizure of new territories and resources were finally put to an end in all theaters. By December, the strategic advantage had swung to the Allies. After this, only they would dictate the course of the war, and the Germans and the Japanese could only react. Of course, the British would claim that the tide was turned in Egypt near El Alamein on October 24, when Bernard Montgomery managed to beat the Desert Fox Erwin Rommel and his African Corps, who were exhausted by a shortage of supplies. This put an end to German attempts to invade Egypt and block the Suez Canal, which would have significantly complicated the situation for England, since the island nation was extremely dependent on food and resources supplied by its colonies. Two weeks later, the British in North Africa were already supported by the Americans in the West, who were conducting Operation Torch a large-scale troop landing in Morocco and Algeria, which were formally under the control of France s pro-Hitler Vichy government. Despite Rommel s stubborn resistance in Tunisia, the outcome of the campaign was a foregone conclusion. However, the Americans themselves tend to believe that the outcome of the war in the fall of 1942 was decided not in North Africa, but on the opposite side of the world on the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific. The landmass was of great strategic importance, as control over it made it possible to secure commercial shipping between Australia and the United States and threaten the large Japanese naval base in Rabaul (New Britain). In August, US Marine Corps units landed on the island and immediately captured an important airbase, later called Henderson Field. Throughout the autumn, the Marines successfully defended this site with the support of aviation and the navy. The decisive battle was on November 13-14, when the Japanese lost their entire landing force, which was supposed to support the garrison of Guadalcanal, as well as several large ships, including the battleships Hiei and Kirishima. Japan s expansion to the south was checked at the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and it only lost previously captured territories after December of 1942. But, in point of fact, neither Hitler nor Stalin had any doubts that the future of the world was being determined on the Volga steppes from November 19 to 24, when 270,000 Wehrmacht troops under the command of Friedrich Paulus were forced into a cauldron by a heavy blow from the Southwestern and Stalingrad fronts. The subsequent failure to unblock the encircled units doomed the Blau plan and killed any hopes Berlin had for a successful outcome to the war. The German General Staff called the plan of action on the eastern front Fall Blau , or Blue. The main goal of the campaign in the summer of 1942 was initially to capture the oil fields of Maikop and Grozny. The fuel reserves stored in Germany before the war were coming to an end, and synthetic fuel and Romanian oil from Ploiesti were not enough to service all of the Wehrmacht s tanks and Luftwaffe s planes. Therefore, the offensive in the Caucasus was considered a priority. Stalingrad was a secondary goal, and storming the city was not envisaged. It would be enough to pummel it with constant artillery fire, as was the case with Leningrad. However, at first things went so well for the Germans that capturing the industrial and transport center on the Volga began to look like an easy and even natural task. This deceptively low-hanging fruit eventually buried the Third Reich. The Red Army s failures in the spring and summer were primarily due to Stalin s and the Soviet High Command s mistakes in assessing the enemy s plans. The fact is that the invasion of the USSR was initially dictated by the need to seize the resources of Ukraine and the North Caucasus. It was the seizure of the Lebensraum im Osten the living space in the East that Hitler and Rosenberg first thought about when authorizing the Barbarossa plan. This was also anticipated by Stalin, who concentrated his main forces in the west of Ukraine in 1941. Due to the suddenness of the attack and catastrophic errors in management, these troops were destroyed in the Battle of the Border and later near Odessa and Kiev. But the German generals, led by Chief of General Staff Franz Halder and Paulus the main drafter of the Barbarossa plan (such is the historical irony) were able to convince the Fuhrer of the need to repeat the blitzkrieg that brought victory in France. They considered it possible to destroy or trap the main part of the Soviet army in cauldrons with tank spearheads, after which they could take the enemy s capital and force a surrender. However, the stubborn resistance of the Red Army near Smolensk and Moscow proved that such calculations were a mistake, even if not yet fatal. In the 1942 campaign, Stalin was sure his adversary would try to finish what he had begun and take Moscow. Therefore, the main forces of the Red Army were concentrated in the central part of the country. But this time Hitler had no choice he had to urgently ensure the safety of the Kuban agricultural fields and the mines of Donbass, get Grozny oil, and prepare an offensive on the Baku and Azerbaijani oil fields. The Red Army forces weak position in the south deteriorated further after an incompetent attempt by Semyon Timoshenko s troops to retake Kharkov in May. As a result of a counteroffensive conducted by the 6th Paulus Army and 1st Panzer Group Kleist, 240,000 Soviet soldiers and officers were captured in the Barvenkov cauldron alone. The front actually collapsed, and what official reports called a strategic retreat was, in practice, more like an escape. It was at this moment that Hitler, inspired by this success, decided to divide Army Group South into two parts. The first was sent to the south to fulfill the main mission of capturing the oil fields, which by that time had already been set on fire by Soviet oilmen, with a subsequent strike on Rostov-on-Don. The second consisting of the 6th Paulus Army, the 4th Goth Tank Army, and two armies made up of Romanians, Hungarians, and Italians was to pursue the Soviet units retreating to the east with the aim of besieging Stalingrad and capturing Astrakhan by winter. While controlling Astrakhan would have completely cut central Russia off from Caucasian oil, Hitler saw the attack on Stalingrad more as a personal blow to the enemy s leader, as the city bore his name. It was here in 1918 that Stalin found his most loyal political ally, Voroshilov, as well as his main enemy, Trotsky. It was also here that American engineers had built one of the symbols of Stalin s industrialization policy, representing the industrial power of the USSR a colossal tractor plant. The resistance to the main onslaught, which was organized by the 62nd and 64th Armies on the distant approaches to the city, was weak and clearly ineffective in steppe conditions. It seemed to the German command that the Russians were about to finally run out of strength, and the last defenders of the city would die in its ruins amidst the smoke and fires from incessant bombing. How wrong they were. Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov was recalled to Stalingrad from China, where he had served as a military attaché and chief military advisor to Chiang Kai-shek since December 1940. He had thus missed the initial stage of the Great Patriotic War, although he had been asking to be sent to the frontlines ever since the fighting started. It may just be that not having the weight of the bitter defeats of the first year of the war on his shoulders gave Chuikov the moral fortitude to keep defending Stalingrad till the end. What made him famous though was his personal courage, doggedness, strictness bordering on rudeness, and even a certain daredevil attitude. Back in July 1942, his plane was shot down by a German fighter while he was inspecting his defense positions. Three months later, on October 14, as the city was being stormed for the third time, even his nerves of steel were beginning to rattle as the army headquarters was hit with a projectile. Chuikov suffered a blast injury, dozens of army staff members died. And yet he remained firmly committed to his motto: There is no land for us behind the Volga. What did Stalingrad look like in September-October 1942? It was a narrow strip, hardly more than 1km wide, of densely built residential and industrial areas that had been devastated by bombing and shelling. Buried in the rubble were the corpses of several thousand civilians and soldiers from both sides. The air was foul with the stench of burning factories: Red October, Barrikady, the brick plant, and, of course, the giant Stalingrad Tractor Plant. Oil was burning and seeping from storage tanks into the Volga, as barges and boats carried reinforcements from the left bank to the right and wounded soldiers from the right bank to the left at night under relentless enemy aircraft fire. By mid-November, the Soviet 62nd Army s line of defense had been split into several islands. It is difficult to give exact numbers because fighting continued nonstop, but experts say there were no more than 20,000 Soviet troops along the actual line of contact and about three times as many German soldiers from General Paulus Sixth Army (with the total size of the German group estimated at about 270,000). A lot of the action was almost hand-to-hand combat. Trapped by rubble and barricades, German tanks couldn t maneuver and became an easy target for antitank guns and Molotov cocktails. Frontlines would run across staircases in apartment buildings, with Soviets often mounting counteroffensives at night approaching from basements, attics, or sewer pipes. Snipers attracted a lot of attention, with Soviet propaganda extolling Vasily Zaitsev as a hero. His legendary, albeit not entirely corroborated by historical evidence, duel with the chief instructor of a German sniper school was the inspiration for Enemy at the Gates , a Hollywood movie, where Zaitsev, a simple lad from the Urals region of Russia, is played by Jude Law. According to veterans reports, however, it was not the sniper rifle that decided the outcome of the Battle of Stalingrad but the simple PPSh submachine-gun, with its very high rate of fire and close combat effectiveness. Before Stalingrad, there had been virtually no historical precedent of fighting in big, built-up cities, except perhaps the siege of Madrid by General Franco s forces. There were no manuals or guidelines describing urban fighting. Chuikov and his soldiers wrote those rules with blood on the destroyed walls of buildings. The general and his army, later renamed the 8th Guards Army, drew on that experience later during the Battle for Berlin, which fell within a week. Since then, cities rather than fields and woods have increasingly seen the fiercest fighting, from Warsaw, Konigsberg, and Seoul to Grozny, Fallujah, and Mariupol. Modern warfare was born in Stalingrad. Temperatures fell sharply to 18-20 degrees Celsius below zero at night in early November. As the German Sixth Army, worn out by a months-long offensive, freezing, decimated by bloody urban fighting, and suffering from inconsistent supplies along the few steppe roads, which autumn rains had turned into mud, was persevering in its attempts to carry out Hitler s orders and push Chuikov s army into the river, its fate was decided hundreds of kilometers away from Stalingrad at the flanks of the overextended front that were protected by poorly equipped and under-motivated Romanian armies. It was there that the main strikes of Operation Uranus were delivered on November 19 and 20. Uranus was the first in a series of brilliant Red Army operations, which already bore many of the hallmarks that came to define the strategy of the Soviet General Staff. First was the highly unpredictable choice of the main strike areas, as the attacks were not aimed at the flanks of the Sixth Army itself but rather at areas deep behind it. Second, maximum secrecy was adhered to during the preparation period to conceal the true intentions from the enemy. The perceived hopelessness of the resistance on the part of the defenders of Stalingrad lulled Hitler into assuming, until the very last, that the Red Army was fighting at the top of its capabilities and had no resources for a counteroffensive. Third, unorthodox solutions were found to complex problems and ample supplies were provided to the attacking forces. A case in point is the airborne mission to supply antifreeze to the mechanized units of the 51st and 57th Armies that were being deployed in the steppes south of Stalingrad. The cold snap was forcing armor crews to dig pits under their tanks, cover them with tarps for protection and keep fires burning under them to prevent water coolant from freezing and destroying the engines. In the absence of a proper road system, it was impossible to deliver enough antifreeze within the short period of time left before the launch of the offensive. Eventually, over 60 tons of antifreeze coolant was brought from the Moscow region by air using cargo gliders. In the course of a week, pilots completed about 60 resupply missions, flying in a semi-reclined position inside plywood contraptions in freezing cold, often at night. Finally, Uranus was the first major operation executed in accordance with the deep operations theory developed by Vladimir Triandafillov in the 1920s. The theory, which emphasizes destroying enemy forces not only at the line of contact but throughout the depth of the battlefield, was refined and introduced into the Red Army manual by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. After Stalin s purges of the military in 1937 and Tukhachevsky s execution, the theory was declared wrong and even harmful. Yet it was borne out by practice and was crucial for the success of the Battle of Stalingrad. The same approach was used with the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of the Dnieper, Operation Bagration, the Vistula-Oder offensive, and many others. Traditionally, the main outcomes of the Battle of Stalingrad are said to be the frustration of Germany s offensive plans, Moscow retaining control over oil supplies from Baku along the Volga, the Wehrmacht s large-scale retreat, the protection of the Caucasus from further German advances, the fact that the Red Army now had the strategic initiative, and a major boost to the Soviet troops morale after such a decisive victory culminating in the capture of a German field marshal. The foreign-policy dimension is also frequently discussed, as it paved the way, in the winter of 1943, for the first negotiations between the Allies about the post-war spheres of influence, which eventually led to the Tehran Conference. However, there is one important consideration that is usually ignored because it goes way beyond one theater and has to do with the bigger picture of the war. What if, instead of getting bogged down in Stalingrad, Hitler had continued with his initial plan of capturing the Caucasus? What if he and his high command had been more realistic in assessing their capabilities? What if the Germans had succeeded in crushing Chuikov s 62nd Army after all? Just before the Second Battle of El Alamein, Erwin Rommel had to leave his army and return to Europe to treat his diphtheria. As he was preparing to hand over command to his subordinate, Rommel wrote a detailed memo for the Fuhrer describing the situation at hand and asking him to advance into the Caucasus as soon as possible. If the German troops had not been immobilized in Stalingrad in the summer of 1942 and had instead moved into Transcaucasia, Britain would have been forced to transfer its troops from Africa to northern Iran. Pro-German sentiment was strong in Iraq, while Syria and Lebanon were controlled by the collaborationist French Vichy regime. Turkey, which remained neutral until almost the very end of the war, had strong economic ties to Germany. After the defeat in World War I stripped Berlin of its colonies, the revival of the country s economy was mainly due to new markets in the Balkans and Turkey. Surrounded by the Germans on all sides, Ankara would likely have joined the Axis, especially given the prevalence of nationalist and revanchist sentiment in the country, as well as the age-long dream of seizing control over southern Azerbaijan from Iran. This development would have changed the situation globally, creating a new theater and threatening British oil production in Iran. Ultimately, it would have improved Germany s chances of winning the war, or at least protracting it by a year or two. In any case, November 1942 would certainly not be seen as the turning point of World War II today.

The contrast in geographical size will be particularly stark when compared to the Russia World Cup, which spanned 12 stadiums across 11 host cities, ranging from Kaliningrad in the west to Ekaterinburg in the Urals. The tournament in Russia was widely hailed as a major success, both on and off the pitch. Nonetheless, Sorokin said that organizers can never be fully ready even if he praised Qatar for its efforts, including the adoption of free transport for fans, something seen in Russia four years ago. It would be a little presumptuous to say that everything is definitely ready. I repeat once again great preparations have been made [in Qatar], great efforts and funds have been invested, said Sorokin. The country takes the tournament very seriously. It can be said that it has united around this event it has rallied the efforts of all branches of government, all departments. The build-up to the tournament in Qatar has been mired in Western media debate about conditions for migrant workers and the Gulf state s treatment of the LGBT community. Sorokin noted that Russia had also been criticized in the Western press in the lead-up to its own showpiece four years ago, with the same being true of Brazil in 2014 and South Africa in 2010. In terms of Qatari customs clashing with fans attitudes, Sorokin recommended that visitors be aware of local traditions, but said he does not expect excessive rigorism from officials. Here, I would reduce it to respect for local orders and the amendment that this is not a European country. But I don t expect any persecution or reprisals, said Sorokin. Russian President Vladimir Putinextended his best wishes to Qatarfor the World Cup at a meeting with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on the sidelines of a summit in Astana last month. Al-Thani thanked Russia for its support, praising it for provid[ing] great support to Qatar, especially in terms of organization. The Qatari team begin the tournament when they play Ecuador at the 60,000-seater Al-Bayt Stadium in Doha on Sunday. The Russian team will be absent in Qatar after being banned from the European qualification playoffs because of the conflict in Ukraine.

"14 Nov, 2022",Vladimir Putin is absent from this week's G20 summit: What does it mean for the Russian President and the event itself?,"As Sergey Lavrov replaces the country's leader on the sunshine island, what do Russian experts think about the situation? This week's G20 summit, in Indonesia, is unlikely to be a pleasant event for Russia. Information suggests that many of theevent s participants intend torefuseto take part in photo-ops with representatives of Russia, and will even try toisolatethem. If this speculation proves true, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will take the full brunt, as he will be the one leading the delegation. According to the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin has personally decided to skip the summit due to his busy schedule and the need for him to stay in Russia. Participants of the G20 summit have already arrived in Bali, and it seems that some wish Putin was there. French President Emmanuel Macron has stated the need to continue dialogue with Russian President, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz admitted that""it would be good if Putin went,""and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan believes that the participation of his Russian counterpart would be appropriate. All this is against the backdrop of China's support. The Washington Posthas writtenthat Western countries are alarmed by the partnership between Putin and Xi. The newspaper's sources do not think that Beijing will refuse to support Russia at the summit even after the meeting between Biden and and the Chinese head-of-state. Although several days have passed since Sergey Lavrov s trip was announced, it is still unknown whether any bilateral meetings are planned for the Russian minister. In particular, Moscow has yet to mention a possible encounter with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The main news about Lavrov in Bali, so far, was pushed by AP and some other Western outlets, on Monday, reporting that he had been taken to hospital with heart problems shortly after arriving. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said these reports are top-level fake news . The diplomat, who is also in Bali, said that she was reading the news with the foreign minister and they both just couldn t believe our eyes. Earlier she announced that Lavrov plans to speak at the summit about Russia s initiatives to provide food and energy to foreign markets. In addition, Moscow s agenda includes presenting its plan to enhance gas cooperation with Turkey. In general, this fits into the official G20 agenda. According to preliminary information, the summit s participants plan to discuss health issues, the transition to sustainable energy, and digital transformation. However, it is not known whether the 2022 Bali summit will be useful in helping the world take a step forward in overcoming the Ukrainian crisis, as some expect. So far, all the statements of Western leaders have indicated the opposite. Western countries have been putting pressure on the summit s host to exclude the Russian Federation from the event since Vladimir Putin announced the military operation in Ukraine last February. For example, the US president s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that Russia can no longer take part in the international community s business as usual, while Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau even suggested that his country should take Moscow s place in the G20 club. Nevertheless, Indonesia sent an invitation to President Putin, despite the pressure. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was also invited to take part in the meeting, despite the fact that his country is not a member of the G20, and not remotely close to meeting the criteria. However, the leaders of the two countries wouldn t have met in person in any case. Zelensky also refused to visit Bali but is expected to take part in the summit in an online format. Oleg Barabanov, program director of Moscow's Valdai International Discussion Club, believes it's best to separate the standard issues on the G20 agenda from the expectations of possible agreements on Ukraine that could have been made on the sidelines with the participation of Vladimir Putin. The annual agenda of the G20 includes discussing the green economy, as well as the fight against poverty and inequality. One of the main issues that will be addressed in Indonesia this year is recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Though it s a pity that Putin will not take part in this, these issues will nevertheless be considered with the participation of Lavrov, Barabanov told RT. On the other hand, he says various backstage discussions, meetings, and searches for compromise on the crisis could really have taken place in Bali. Obviously, nothing will happen now. And expectations that the G20 summit could lead to a breakthrough in settling the Ukrainian conflict were not justified, the expert lamented. Academic Director at the Higher School of Economics Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies (CCEIS), Timofey Bordachev, in turn, warns against exaggerating the impact of Putin s absence from the Bali summit. By and large, nothing will be lost because Putin s not going to the G20. I don t think the Chinese will be very happy about it. They want formats like this to continue, as the leadership role will gradually shift from the West to China. It will also be a little unpleasant for Western countries that wanted to put on a show in front of the Russian president. Now the performance will be staged in front of Lavrov. Russia won t lose anything at all because it doesn t face any issues dependent on the G20 s cooperation. I don t think the Indonesians will be too offended either. They rebuffed all attempts by the US to exclude Russia, but they did it for their own sake, to show that Indonesia isn t beholden to the United States, Bordachev told RT. Andrey Suzdaltsev, a political scientist, also believes that there was no great need for Vladimir Putin to go to the summit, but for a different reason. It doesn t make much sense for Russia to go to the G20 now. For Putin to appear there, Russia needed to have some kind of advantage, be it military, economic, or political. For example, the advance in the Donbass, but definitely not the evacuation from Kherson. In addition, it s necessary to have international support here Russia at least has contacts with China and India. You also need to offer your own initiatives, bring a briefcase with you. Russia has failed to do this now, which means that it is, in fact, pointless to go. It s one thing if you have a lot of authority, and another when you have some problems, Suzdaltsev said. Vladimir Zharikhin, deputy director of the Institute of CIS Countries, thinks it can be useful to communicate with the leaders of non-G7 countries at the G20. The importance of the G20 will decrease somewhat due to the absence of Putin. No matter how many nasty things they throw at him, he s one of the leading leaders of the world. Yes, Lavrov will be there. But, as the saying goes, sand is no substitute for oats. With all due respect to the Russian Foreign Minister, this, of course, still constitutes a downgrade in the level of representation, and a decrease in the significance of the G20. After all, they are going to discuss pressing world problems there, one of which is the wide conflict between Russia and the West. It is much more difficult to discuss this without Putin s participation, Zharikhin explained. The G20 format was born in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis, when the mainly Western countries in the Big Seven the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada realized that a number of large economies were not participating in discussions on global issues. The newcomers invited to the table include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, China, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, South Korea, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union. However, the format did not reach its current status until the next global financial crisis, in 2008-2009. Prior to that, the meetings had only included finance ministers and the heads of central banks. However, subsequently world leaders themselves met at the summits annually to consult, first and foremost, on financial and economic issues. In 2013, the G20 was held in St. Petersburg. The goal of the format was to achieve global economic stability and to create conditions for sustainable growth, while reducing the risk that financial crises would occur. The G20 countries are home to two-thirds of the world s population. They also account for 85% of world GDP and about 75% of world trade. Decisions of the G20 are by consensus and are recorded in a communiqué, but are not binding. Russian experts have been skeptical about how effective the group has been in recent years. In general, both the G20 and the G7 stand for everything good against everything bad. Year in and year out, they publish beautiful communiqués calling for all the right things. But it s difficult to say how much of this is actually implemented in real politics. Moreover, every year, a new chair country sets the tasks for the year, while ignoring what its predecessor had included, Barabanov points out. According to Bordachev, the last few years have betrayed the club s lack of effectivity in solving the world economy s most important problems. In recent years, it seems that everyone has been solving their problems individually. The format exists, and no one wants to abandon it because everyone wants a stage on which to speak out, but everyone really acts in their own interests. China is trying to gradually rebuild these institutions and organizations, which the West created with its own goals, according to its own vision. And now it s important for Western countries to come out as a united front to show their unity to the world. But, of course, mistakes and problems that can t be solved will not be recognized in the general communiqué, he expects. Zharikhin shares a similar point of view. In his opinion, all meetings and agreements have become devalued because the world s former leader, the United States, builds its policy as if in a game without rules. Tomorrow they ll say that they ve decided otherwise we remember how they ve withdrawn from treaties and failed to fulfill their obligations. Objectively, all international organizations, starting with the UN, are losing their influence. But the point of participating in them still remains precisely for the sake of communicating with non-Western countries that are ready to seek compromise, he believes. Suzdaltsev agrees that there is not much life in G20 resolutions, since they contain mostly guidelines for the future. But there is a negotiating element at summits like these, and the G20 provides a forum for this. It s still better than having a war, he says.

"14 Nov, 2022",Southern African nation starts LNG exports,"Mozambique reportedly has the capacity to become one of the world s 10 biggest suppliers of the fuel Mozambique has made its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipment, the country s president announced on Sunday. The first batch of LNG produced at the country s offshore Coral Sul facility has left Mozambique territorial waters, Filipe Nyusi said. Today, Mozambique enters the annals of world history as one of the exporting countries of LNG, Nyusi said in a video statement, as cited by AFP news agency. The plant is managed by Italian company Eni, and according to Nyusi, the shipment was ordered by British oil major BP. Mozambique has the largest natural gas deposits south of the Sahara Desert,holdingroughly 2.8 trillion cubic meters of proven reserves or around 1% of the world s total. They were discovered in the country s northern Cabo Delgado province in 2010. Estimates show that given the extent of the deposits, the country could become one of the world's 10 biggest LNG exporters. According todatafrom Statista.com, Mozambique could also become Africa s third largest exporter of the fuel after Algeria and Nigeria. Coral Sul can produce 3.4 million tons of LNG per year. However, the plant is the only one of three large energy projects in Mozambique currently in operation. The remaining two, operated by France s TotalEnergies and US oil giant ExxonMobil, have been halted due to political instability in the country. Eni's CEO Claudio Descalzi welcomed the first gas shipment from Coral Sul, calling it a significant step forward in the company s work to leverage gas as a source that can contribute in a significant way to Europe's energy security, also through the increasing diversification of supplies. Securing energy supplies has become a key focus for the EU this year, due to a plunge in gas imports from the bloc s former main supplier, Russia.

"13 Nov, 2022",Kremlin reveals contents of Putin's call with Iranian leader,"Moscow and Tehran seek to boost cooperation amid Western pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday, in which the leaders of heavily sanctioned nations discussed further ways to improve bilateral ties amid Western pressure. The leaders discussed a number of current issues on the bilateral agenda with an emphasis on the continued building up of interaction in politics, trade and the economy, including transport and logistics, accordingto a brief readout of the conversation from the Kremlin. According to Tehran, Raisi welcomed Moscow's keenness to improve economic cooperation with Iran, notinghow the recent increase in diplomatic and economic exchanges was strengthening the ties between the two countries. Russia and Iran are rapidly expanding their energy and trade ties amid the Western sanctions imposed on both nations. Barter deals, such as a $40 billion agreement with Russian energy major Gazprom expected to be finalized in December, help the countries avoid settlement issues presented by the Western financial system. They also enjoy direct trade links via the Caspian Sea. In June, the Islamic Republic of Iran officially submitted its application to join the group of five BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) which account for over 40% of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world s GDP. The bloc s stated purposes include promoting peace, security, development, and cooperation globally, and contributing to the development of humanity. Earlier this week, Russia's Security Council chief Nikolay Patrushev visited Tehran, where he met a number of senior officials including his security counterpart Ali Shamkhani and President Raisi. The trip triggered fresh Western media speculation about the countries security ties, following weeks of claims that Iran has been supplying Russia with kamikaze drones. Both Moscow and Tehran have repeatedly denied that arms deliveries have taken place amid the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. Kiev insists that drones designated by Moscow as Russian-made Geran-2 are actually Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 UAVs. Last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said that his nation only provided Russia with a small number of drones before the start of the conflict.

"12 Nov, 2022",Turkiye appoints first envoy to Israel in four years,"The killing of dozens of Palestinian civilians in 2018 led to a falling out Turkiye has appointed a veteran diplomat to serve as the country s first ambassador to Israel in four years. The presidential decree naming Sakir Ozkan Torunlar to the post came on Friday, according to Turkish media. Torunlar previously served as consul general in Jerusalem between 2010 and 2014. The two countries have not been on diplomatic speaking terms since May 2018, when Ankara recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv. The move came after dozens of Palestinian civilians were killed following the actions of the Israel Defense Forces during the Great March of Return border demonstration. Afterwards, Turkiye ordered Israeli Ambassador Eitan Naeh to leave the majority-Muslim country. Israel responded by ordering the departure of Turkish Consul Husnu Gurcan Turkoglu, who oversaw Ankara s relations with the Palestinian territories. Turkiye then expelled Israel s consul general, Yossi Levi Safri, from Istanbul, and the two countries subjected each other s envoys to excessive airport screenings and paper inspections. At the time, South Africa also recalled its Israeli ambassador, and several nations issued condemnatory statements but the rupture in other countries diplomatic relations was brief. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been especially critical of Israeli politician Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him the PM of an apartheid state that has occupied a defenseless people s lands for 60+ years in violation of UN resolutions during the 2018 diplomatic spat. However, Erdogan wrote to the newly-elected leader earlier this month, congratulating him on his political comeback. ",https://www.rt.com/news/566408-turkiye-ambassador-israel-mend-netanyahu/
"12 Nov, 2022",Western Europeans will try to isolate Russia at G20 Telegraph,"London and Brussels will reportedly encourage others to walk out during the Russian delegation s speeches The UK and the EU intend to coordinate their efforts and do everything possible to make the Russian delegation feel unwelcome at the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia s Bali, The Telegraph has claimed. The outlet conceded, however, that China and possibly several other key players would be highly unlikely to follow suit. We try to work with partners in order to show very, very, very firmly what the international community thinks about all these crimes, atrocities, and illegal actions by Russia, a spokesperson for the EU s foreign affairs service told the paper. The spokesperson explained that the bloc, together with the UK, will not only shun Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and stage walkouts during addresses by Moscow s delegation, but also try to convince other nations to do the same. According to the anonymous official, while the UK is not keen on coordinating with the EU on foreign policy in general, the concerted efforts to isolate Russia have proven to be an exception, as London and Brussels have the same objective. The report also quoted a French government source as saying that the meeting in Bali will not be business as usual and will center on the Ukraine conflict. There will be a coalition and Russia is isolated, the official concluded. The article noted, however, that the total isolation of Russia at the event is unlikely, as the country enjoys close relations with China. One unnamed EU official told the paper that Moscow and Beijing are expected to water down any joint statement calling for de-escalation in Ukraine. The report also suggested that the likes of India, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, which have not joined Western sanctions against Moscow, could break ranks with the EU and UK this time as well. Relations between Moscow and the West have hit an all-time low in the wake of the Russian military operation in Ukraine. However, Moscow has insisted that any attempts to isolate the country will fail. The key organizations that Russia is part of, such as BRICS, are also expanding. In fact, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed following a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last month that Riyadh would like to join BRICS, which currently comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. On top of that, media reports claimed back in July that Turkiye and Egypt might also be interested.

Speaking at a meeting with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Lavrov indicated that membership of the BRICS bloc is in high demand. The interest in this global association is very, very high and continues to grow, he said. He confirmed that more than a dozen countries are eager to join, including Algeria, Argentina, and Iran. However, Lavrov continued, before accepting any new members, BRICS intends to reach an agreement on criteria and principles for further potential expansion. Given that applications are already being submitted officially, we, of course, expect that harmonization of the criteria and principles for the expansion of BRICS won t take too long, he said. BRICS is an international socio-economic and political forum, which incorporates Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It accounts for over 40% of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world s GDP.

"7 Nov, 2022",Ex-Russian president names key reason for Ukraine conflict,"Kiev s nuclear ambitions spurred Moscow s military operation, Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine s threat to resume its nuclear program was one of the key reasons that forced Russia to launch its military operation in late February, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday. Writing on the Russian social media network Vkontakte, he argued that the Ukrainian authorities are now crying bitterly over their decision to relinquish the nuclear arsenal they inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kiev made this decision after caving in to harsh pressure of their current masters in Washington, Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia s Security Council, stated. He added that all Ukrainian presidents from the late Leonid Kravchuk to the incumbent Vladimir Zelensky described the step as a forced one. However, according to the official, Kiev has made clear that it would be diabolically happy to use nukes against Russia and their own citizens . They have been dropping explicit hints about this, threatening to resume the nuclear program. And that was one of the reasons for conducting the special military operation, he insisted. Medvedev also drew a sharp contract between Ukraine and South Africa, the first country with a nuclear arsenal to voluntarily give it up. He noted that after the collapse of the apartheid regime, the nation s new democratic authorities took a responsible and sovereign stance towards their people, neighboring countries and the entire world community . And today they do not regret the choice made 30 years ago, they are proud of it and show the way for others by their example, he added. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine surrendered its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in exchange for promises from the US, Britain and Russia that they would provide assistance to the country in case of aggression. The three states also vowed not to attack Ukraine themselves. However, Russian officials have repeatedly stated that this document was undermined by NATO s eastward expansion, which threatened Moscow s vital security interests. Moreover, prior to the start of the Ukraine conflict in late February, Zelenksy signaled that Kiev could give up its decades-old pledge to be a non-nuclear nation and reverse the decision it took to give up its atomic weapons.

According to the outlet, the government also intends to set up a 200 million slavery awareness fund which will finance the relevant projects and dedicated school programs. Additional 27 million will be allocated to create a slavery museum, RTL s sources said. The government s move will constitute a formal response to a report last year by the Dialogue Group on Slavery History. The commission, which was set up by the Interior Ministry, recommended that Prime Minister Mark Rutte should recognize and apologize for past slavery. On the one hand, recognition will give satisfaction to those who suffered under slavery, and on the other hand, it will promote a critical view of Dutch history in a broader sense, the group said at the time. The formal apology, which is not expected until mid-December, will reportedly be supported by most MPs, while key parliamentary parties have already called on the government to take a stand. In July, 2021, the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, officially apologized for the active involvement of the city in the commercial system of colonial slavery. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Netherlands maintained colonies in the regions known today as Indonesia, South Africa, Curaçao and New Guinea. It was one of the last countries to abolish slavery, doing so in 1863 in its main colony of Surinam in South America. The year 2023 will mark 150 years since the Netherlands freed tens of thousands slaves there and on the Dutch Caribbean islands.

Russia was represented by Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin, who praised the non-discriminatory attitude among BRICS members at a time when Russian athletes have been banned from a variety of international competitions. Sports cooperation between the BRICS countries is built in the spirit of partnership, equality, mutual respect and non-discrimination, Matytsin said ina statementshared by his ministry.

She called the idea of ending Western nations reliance on Beijing for the critical minerals a pipe dream. That s a country that has seen this need coming and made the most of it, she told the agency on Tuesday. According to King, however, this won t stop Australia and the US from cooperating to boost investments into the minerals that are vital for the defense, aerospace, and automotive sectors in order to break Beijing s monopoly on global supply chains. The minister added that Canberra s goal was to make the most of the natural endowment we have of these resources, so that we can provide an alternative source of them from China. Rare-earth metals are a group of 17 chemical elements that are not actually rare but difficult to find in the necessary concentrations and hard to process because they often contain naturally occurring radioactive materials such as uranium and thorium. The elements are widely used by manufacturers of products such as cell phones, automobiles, military equipment, and even dishwashers. Rare-earth metals are also extracted in India, South Africa, Canada, Estonia, Malaysia, and Brazil. Rare earths have long been at the center of the US-China trade war, while Australia, which has some of the world s largest reserves of these resources and is among the biggest producers of critical minerals globally, supports Washington in the spat. Meanwhile, the US, which used to be the world s leading producer of the minerals is now heavily dependent on China, which accounts for nearly 80% of global rare-earth production and holds the largest reserves. Countries with critical mineral resources should play a positive role in protecting the safety and stability of relevant industrial supply chains, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.

Speaking at an SCO videoconference on Tuesday, Mishustin said the strongest pressure from the collective West had been applied to Russian sport in recent months because of the conflict in Ukraine. Russian athletes have faced widespread bans from international competitions since Moscow began its military campaign in February something which Mishustin said was contrary to the principle of sport remaining outside politics. The SCO member states are unanimous that sports competitions should remain an effective and accessible tool for building trust and mutual understanding between peoples Together we must fight any attempts to destroy the lofty principles of Olympism, Mishustin said at an SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting, in comments shared byTASS. Last month at an SCO summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Russian President Vladimir Putinsuggested that the organization could set up a formal associationof sports federations. It was recently noted by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko that the collective population of the SCO nations numbers in the billions, providing a huge potential audience for sporting collaboration. Elsewhere, Russian officials have consistently talked up the idea of more competitions with members of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) nations.

Philani Mthembu, executive director of the Institute for Global Dialogue"," The political map of the world, as it exists today, is in large part the result of the anti-colonial struggle of the 20th century, which created many new states without necessarily unchaining them from economic and political dependence. National destiny, sovereign decision-making, fair world order and freedom not to be in servitude to somebody else s interests — all of these issues seem to be as relevant today as they were 50 or 60 years ago.

"26 Oct, 2022",US warns about potential terrorist attack,"A Johannesburg neighborhood is being targeted, according to the US embassy, which gave no details Terrorists are plotting an attack on a crowded public space in an upscale Johannesburg neighborhood, according to a security alert issued by the US embassy in South Africa on Wednesday. The embassy warned its staff to avoid crowds in that area over the weekend. The warning states that the US government no specific agency or individual was tipped off that terrorists are planning to conduct an attack targeting large gatherings of people at an unspecified location in the greater Sandton area of Johannesburg on October 29. Sandton is a major financial and business hub, hosting Johannesburg s stock exchange, as well as numerous corporate offices and high-end shopping developments. In addition to Halloween celebrations, the weekend s scheduled events include the city's annual LGBTQ Pride parade. While the US warning did not specify any further information regarding the timing, method, or target of the potential attack, media speculation has drifted toward the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group, which threatened in 2020 to open a fighting front inside [South Africa s] borders should the country intervene militarily in Mozambique, where IS had been taking credit for attacks. However, no communications from the typically boastful terror group preceded Washington s latest announcement. South Africa, a member of the BRICS trade and cooperation group that includes Russia and China, has refused to enforce US and EU sanctions on Russia, stating the measures hurt bystander countries. Several African nations have lost or stand to lose access to cheap food and fertilizer due to the restrictions imposed by the West. President Cyril Ramaphosa last month urged the US not to punish African countries for working with Russia on trade and development projects, arguing a proposed piece of US legislation would harm and marginalize the continent by pressuring independent countries to distance themselves from Moscow.

"26 Oct, 2022",South Africa snubs anti-Russia sanctions,"Steel tycoon Alexey Mordashov is free to dock his superyacht in the country, the president s spokesman said South Africa has no intention of enforcing Western sanctions against Russian businessman Alexey Mordashov, meaning his $500 million megayacht may enter local ports, the spokesman for President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters, Vincent Magwenya, the spokesman for the South African leader, noted that Pretoria has no legal obligation to abide by sanctions imposed by the US and EU, adding that the nation s authorities adhere to UN sanctions. However, referring to the Russian tycoon, Magwenya added that currently there are no UN-imposed sanctions on the particular individual. South Africa therefore has no reason to prevent the vessel s entry into its ports, he said. Mordashov, who has a net worth of $18.3 billion, is the majority shareholder in steel major Severstal. The EU, UK, and US imposed sanctions on the company following the start of the Russian military campaign in Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, his luxury 142-meter yacht, the 'Nord', last week departed Hong Kong, which also refuses to enforce Western sanctions. It is now en route to the South African port of Cape Town, where it is expected to arrive on November 9. South Africa has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia triggered by the conflict in Ukraine, with its president arguing in late May that the restrictions would hurt bystander countries. Russia and South Africa have warm ties that date back to the 1960s, when the Soviet Union supported anti-apartheid freedom fighters. Moreover, South Africa is a member of BRICS, an international socio-economic and political forum that also includes Brazil, Russia, India and China, with more countries seeking to join. The bloc already accounts for over 40% of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world s GDP. ",https://www.rt.com/news/565381-south-africa-snub-sanctions-russia-yacht/
"26 Oct, 2022",Russian sports minister reacts to Ukraine football exclusion demands,"Football association in Kiev wants to see its Russian counterpart excluded from UEFA and FIFA Ukraine is singing old songs by demanding that the Russian Football Union (RFU) be excluded from world and European governing bodies FIFA and UEFA, according to Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin. The president of the Ukrainian Football Association (UAF), Andrey Pavelko, revealed on Facebook on Tuesday that his organization will demand the exclusion of Russia from UEFA and FIFA. The UAF has sent an immediate appeal to FIFA and UEFA with a demand to apply the most stringent sanctions against the RFU, Pavelko revealed. The action was in relation to a decision to allow clubs from the new regions of Russia and Crimea to compete in Russian football leagues. Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, plus the Donetsk and Lugansk People s Republics, officially became parts of the Russian Federation last month when the populations of those territories voted overwhelmingly in support of the move in referendums. Matytsin said that the UAF was singing old songs and that Russia is aware of what colleagues from abroad are saying about the matter. But we are absolutely confident in our development strategy, uniting strategies, strategies of consolidation, solidarity. That this is the main mission of sport to be together. Everything that goes against this strategy, [that] destroys it, is unacceptable for us, Matytsin added, asreportedby TASS. The Russian sports minister claimed that there are no unfriendly countries in sports and touched on the topic of Russia possibly holding competitions touted to take place between Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) countries and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations. I don t think that you need to make a choice where to turn, he said. We have a constructive dialogue with Asian countries as well. In sports, we have repeatedly said that there are no unfriendly countries, we hold many open tournaments, we invite everyone, but everyone makes a decision in accordance with the political situation in their countries. Russian teams and clubs are already banned from international football competitions by FIFA and UEFA after those organizations followed an International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommendation to take such action when the military operation was launched in Ukraine in late February. The advice was heeded by many other sporting federations as well, leaving Russia frozen out of the international sporting arena.

"25 Oct, 2022","Saudi-US relations deteriorate over oil, but the issue is much deeper","After Biden s attempts to salvage Saudi oil failed ahead of the US midterms, he went back to hollow human rights admonishments Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . US President Joe Biden has threatened consequences over Riyadh s decision to cut oil production, a move that resulted in embarrassment for the Democratic Party leader. The defiant move from Saudi Arabia, however, may be much more complex than meets the eye. Washington has been up in arms ever since the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a long-time US partner in the Middle East, pushed for oil production to be slashed at an OPEC+ meeting earlier this October. The consequences were immediately evident as Biden heads his party into the November midterm elections, oil prices will not drop, which hurts his hopes of defeating the Republicans at the polls. Prominent Democrats began launching tirades against the Kingdom, outraged that the Saudis move could affect the election results. The decision of OPEC+ earlier this month to cut production to a low not seen since 2020 was instantly characterized by Washington as Saudi Arabia taking the side of Russia over the West. To make things worse for Biden, Riyadh has reportedlyexpressedinterest in joining the BRICS economic alliance, currently composed of South Africa, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Saudi Arabia has denied that it made any decisions in order to side with Russia, saying it was especially astonished over claims that it was taking a stance against Ukraine. Although the Saudi decision to cut production is undoubtedly a blow to the West, especially as Europe continues to suffer energy shortages, the move was not likely meant as a political stance on the conflict between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. If anything, the message can be interpreted as an anti-Democratic Party stance, rather than anti-American. Although the rhetoric has shifted in Washington to reflect the original position of the Biden administration when it took office, now focusing on human rights violations and the autocratic nature of the Saudi state, the real reason for this is not genuine concern. Biden was even reported to haveaskedthe Saudi government for a concession so that the oil production cut would not go into effect until after the election, according to Riyadh. But with attempts to postpone the OPEC+ decision proving futile, the US president is nowforcedto address the issue of oil prices in order to salvage votes his party risks losing over the issue ahead of November 8. The Republican Party is clearly favorable to the Saudis own regional agenda, with former President Donald Trump making the Kingdom the destination of his first foreigntripin office. Trump, who still holds significant sway over the Republican Party, was a great ally of both the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates when in office. Through lobbying efforts and other forms of pressure on the Republican Party, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi seemed content with the results they received. Notably, Thomas Barrack, who served as an unofficial Trump administration adviser, has beenaccusedof being a foreign agent for the Emirati government over his role in influencing the former president on major foreign policy issues, and may have greatly reshaped the approach that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have taken for their own regional power. Then there is the hypocritical approach of the Biden administration. The US president claimed, in his first address on his administration s foreign policy agenda, that he was going to hold Riyadh to account for its human rights violations and work to bring the war in Yemen to an end. Biden stated that offensive weapons and other relevant arms sales to Saudi Arabia would be canceled, yet approved weapon sales later that same year. Come 2022, the war in Yemen is far from over and Biden ended uptravelingto Saudi Arabia in order to repair US-Saudi ties. The July trip included a sit-in at an Arab Summit meeting, where the presidentvowedto not walk away from the Middle East. This was coupled with word of Washington readying itself toreconsidersales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia once again, despite the trip not resulting in any tangible benefits for the US global and/or regional agendas. In fact, around a week prior to the latest OPEC+ oil production cut, Saudi-US relationshadhit a new high point as reports emerged of the encouragement of US investors to go to Saudi Arabia; this came after the Kingdom had been involved in a Russia-Ukraine prisoner exchange deal. In response tocallsfrom prominent Democrats to cut ties, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, listed off the following elements that bind US-Saudi relations, in aninterviewwith CNN: We have almost 80,000 Americans living and working inside Saudi Arabia. We have a very strong trade and investment relationship. We work very closely in regards to ensuring our common interests, whether it is to bring peace to Yemen, whether it s to bring peace between Israelis and Arabs, whether it s to stabilize Afghanistan, whether it s to reintegrate Iraq into the Arab fold, whether it s to bring stability to the horn of Africa, whether it s to bring stability and peace in Libya and the G5 countries of the Sahel, whether it s to fight extremism and terrorism. Those interests are permanent and those interests are tremendous. The reason this statement is notable is its clear demonstration of the power that the US can harness through its relationship with Riyadh. The two sides have been joined at the hip since the discovery of oil in 1938, with this relationship greatly improving following the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979. However, Saudi Arabia has not sat back and allowed the US to simply take advantage of it,buying upmajor parts of the US oil market itself and ensuring that its impact on regional affairs has cemented its role as a primary regional player, not just an international gas station. While Saudi Arabia s human rights violations, committed domestically and abroad, are abhorrent, the Biden administration clearly is not interested in them. This is why US-Saudi relations have deteriorated only now, when oil prices and partisan electoral issues are at stake, representing yet another embarrassment for the White House. During Biden s visit to Saudi Arabia, the president reportedly attempted to bring up the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Asthe Saudi accountgoes, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman countered Biden by pointing to the Israeli killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq by US forces the message being: Don t pretend to be something you are not. US-Saudi relations are here to stay, short of Washington attempting to fuel another regime change war, a move that would prove catastrophic for US interests.
