"5 Jun, 2023",Libya deports thousands of Egyptian migrants media,"A Libyan security source said that 4,000 illegal immigrants had been found during raids on human traffickers in the country Thousands of Egyptian migrants have been deported back to their home country on foot from eastern Libya through a land border crossing, reports suggest. A Libyan security source is quoted by Reuters as saying that about 4,000 migrants were discovered during raids on human traffickers following a clash between security forces and smugglers, and that all of them had been deported. However, an Egyptian security source is said to have clarified that only around 2,200 of the 4,000 migrants found were in Libya illegally and thus expelled. While the majority of the migrants were Egyptians, some were also citizens of other African countries. The deportees were taken to a location called Emsaed near the border and then walked about 2km into Egypt, the Egyptian source said, as reported by Reuters. Libya is both a destination and transit country for migrants, due to its job opportunities and geographical location, according to migration agencies. The majority are from Sub-Saharan and Northern Africa, with a smaller number from Asia and the Middle East. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that more than half a million migrants are in Libya, many of whom aim to cross to Europe by boat, while others have found jobs and settled in the oil-rich country. The number of people making the journey from Libya to Europe has significantly increased this year, as reported by Italy, which is the primary destination for most incoming migrant boats. In March, the IOM estimated that some 300 people had died or gone missing and were presumed dead after attempting to cross via the central Mediterranean route. Tripoli s security forces have reportedly destroyed a harbor used by migrant smugglers in a move to stop the illegal crossings.

"4 Jun, 2023","Israel, Egypt investigate deadly border incident","The probe was launched after three IDF soldiers and an Egyptian security officer were killed on Saturday Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with his Egyptian counterpart, Mohamed Ahmed Zaki, over the phone on Saturday, discussing the firefight at the border earlier that day, which claimed the lives of three Israeli soldiers and one Egyptian security officer. The defense chiefs agreed to take measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future, according to the statement from the Egyptian Armed Forces. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that an investigation is being conducted in full cooperation with the Egyptian army. Both sides provided different versions of the skirmish. The IDF initially reported that at around 2:30 am local time on Saturday its soldiers busted a cross-border smuggling operation. The Israeli army later said that two of its soldiers, one of whom was a female sergeant, were gunned down at a border outpost. It added that a third IDF service member was later killed by an Egyptian policeman who had crossed into Israeli territory. The intruder was killed in the ensuing firefight, and a fourth IDF soldier received light injuries, the Israeli army said. The Egyptian Armed Forces said in a statement that the country s border security personnel were chasing drug smuggling elements when one of Egypt s security officials crossed the border and exchanged fire with the Israelis. Cairo did not explain how its official had entered Israeli territory. The Egyptian-Israeli border has remained relatively calm since the countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. An IDF spokesperson was quoted by the media as saying that the last known incursion that ended in casualties occurred around 10 years ago.

Rousseff, a former president of Brazil, told Argentinian Economy Minister Sergio Massa that the NBD s board of directors had formally enabled her to vote on Argentina s entry to the financial organization, the outlet said. Sergio, I have good news, I found the shortcut. The board of directors has agreed to add Argentina to the bank. It will be announced at the August meeting in South Africa, Rousseff reportedly told Massa at the bank s headquarters in Shanghai, adding that it is the fastest way to go straight to August. The lender was established by BRICS member states Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa back in 2014. The five economies of the bloc account for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP. The proposal on Argentina s admission, backed by Brazil, will be discussed at the next meeting of NDB governors scheduled for the first week of August in South Africa. For Argentina, membership of the bank offers the prospect of accessing financial assistance, the news outlet noted. To meet entry requirements, Argentina will have to make a contribution worth $250 million in sovereign bonds to the BRICS bank from its treasury. The talks come at a time when the NDB is negotiating with Saudi Arabia on admitting the kingdom as the tenth member of the BRICS bank. The NDB was launched with the purpose of financing infrastructure and sustainable development in member states and other emerging economies. It also aims to help member states reduce dependence on the US dollar and euro. The multinational lender continues to expand its global reach and already includes Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Egypt. It has lent $33 billion to more than 96 projects in the five founding member nations. ",https://www.rt.com/business/577352-argentina-brics-bank-accession/
"1 Jun, 2023",Black Sea grain deal hits obstacle UN,"Russia has reportedly restricted access to one Ukrainian port until Kiev reactivates a fertilizer pipeline Russia has notified the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul it will restrict the passage of grain ships to the port of Yuzhny until Ukraine reopens the Togliatti-Odessa ammonia pipeline, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Thursday. Dujarric said that Director General Rebecca Greenspan of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is working to resolve the pipeline issue, but there was no progress to report yet, according to the TASS news agency. The UN also expressed concern that the implementation of the deal has slowed down, with only 33 ships leaving Ukrainian ports in May, half of what left in April. Meanwhile, the number of on-site inspection teams has been reduced from three to two. Yuzhny is one of the three ports covered by the July 2022 Black Sea Initiative, the others being Chernomorsk and Odessa. The agreement mediated by the UN and Turkiye provided for the shipments of Ukrainian grain by sea, as well as the unblocking of Russian agricultural exports but only the first part has been implemented. On May 17, Moscow agreed to extend the deal for another 60 days. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoganannouncedthe decision on the eve of the presidential election, which he went on to win in the runoff. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Ukraine s ministry of renovation and infrastructure accused Russia of another unjustified refusal to register the incoming fleet. A senior official in Kiev told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, that Ukraine would consider reopening the Togliatti-Odessa pipeline if the Black Sea deal was expanded to include more ports and more commodities. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin said that none of the five issues Moscow had identified with the deal of which the Togliatti-Odessa pipeline was but one have been addressed by the UN, Our position remains unchanged the export of ammonia is part of the existing agreements and was supposed to start simultaneously with the transportation of Ukrainian grain, Vershinin said, adding that without addressing the five issues, there is no point in discussing the extension of the grain deal beyond July 17. The deal was originally trumpeted in Ukraine and the West as a breakthrough in addressing food shortages in Africa and parts of Asia. According to datarevealedby the Turkish Ministry of Commerce last week, however, 47% of the Ukrainian exports went to the EU, and only 27% reached countries such as Egypt, Kenya, and Sudan. More than 30 million tons of grain have been transported by 953 ships since August 2022, with corn making up 50% of the cargo and wheat another 27%. Much of the grain was not for human consumption, but marked as animal feed. According to research by one Austrian outlet that waspublished in February, almost half the grain that made its way to the EU ended up as fodder for pigs raised by Spanish ham producers.

The current aim of the NDB is to expand links and infrastructure across the bloc and boost the quality of life in member states, the Russian minister stated. The task of the BRICS is to unite, not to divide. Therefore, when the BRICS countries decided to create the NDB, we pursued one simple goal: to create a financial institution for developing countries, so that we all have an additional tool to support our joint development agenda, Siluanov said. According to Siluanov, the bank should focus on areas such as facilitating the transfer of technology and promoting innovation, as well as solving food and energy security problems, developing sustainable infrastructure, and creating development potential. It is important that the NDB remains open to admitting new members and cooperating with all international organizations, Siluanov stressed. The Shanghai-based NDB was established in 2014 by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and formally opened for business a year later. It was later joined by Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Uruguay. Saudi Arabia is also in talks to become a member, the Financial Times reported last week. To date, the NDB has loaned $33 billion to more than 96 projects in its five founding-member countries, according to the bank s website. Dilma Rousseff, NDB president and former president of Brazil, said on Tuesday that the bank would look to work more closely with other multilateral and national banks. It will also aim to finance more projects in local currencies to protect borrowers from fluctuations, she noted. On Monday, the NDB announced the issuance of 8.5 billion yuan worth of panda bonds ($1.23 billion) in China s interbank bond market, with the aim of financing sustainable development projects.

The BRICS bank is scheduled to hold its annual meeting from May 30-31. For Riyadh, membership in the bank offers the prospect of strengthening bonds with the BRICS member states. The five economies account for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP. The talks also come at a time when Saudi Arabia and China are increasing co-operation. In March, Beijing mediated a landmark agreement between the kingdom and Iran, helping to ease regional tensions. Saudi Arabia has also significantly strengthened its energy ties with China.

More than 30 million tons of grain have been transported by 953 shipments via the route since it opened last August, the paper quoted Turkish Ministry of Commerce official Yusuf Karakas as saying. According to Milliyet, the amount of grain transported corresponds to 16.8 billion loaves of bread. Corn made up half of the cargoes, 27% was wheat and 6% was sunflower meal, a by-product of the extraction of oil from sunflower seeds, Karakas added. Brokered with UN and Turkish mediation last July, the deal between Kiev and Moscow has allowed Ukraine to ship its corn, wheat, soy and other grain to international markets. The agreement was intended to stabilize global food prices and help countries in Africa and parts of Asia dependent on imports to meet their needs. However, according to UN figures, only 27% of the grain has gone to low and lower-middle income countries such as Egypt, Kenya and Sudan, while 47% has gone to high-income countries, including Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. Much of Ukraine s grain exports have ended up as animal fodder in wealthy Western countries. A February investigation by an Austrian outlet found that countries at risk of famine had received only 15% of the deliveries, while almost half the corn and wheat exported to the EU went to the makers of Spanish ham to feed their pigs.

""First is the cessation of hostilities. Second is a framework for lasting peace,""South African Presidency Spokesman Vincent Magwenya was quoted as saying by Reuters. The presidents of Egypt, Zambia, Congo, Uganda, South Africa and Senegal have also urged Ukraine to accept opening peace talks with Russia and drop its precondition of a complete withdrawal of Moscow's forces from territories Kiev claims as its own. Moscow, meanwhile, has demanded that Kiev recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which joined the Russian Federation back in 2014, as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People s Republics and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, which joined Russia in 2022. Responding to President Ramaphosa, Ukraine s ambassador to South Africa Lyubov Abravitova stated that""my President made it very clear... no talks between Ukraine and Russia unless Russians leave our territory within its internationally recognised borders."" She confirmed, however, that Kiev would nevertheless welcome the African leaders and speak to them. Responding to the African plan, a US State Department spokesperson also said that Washington would""welcome any successful effort to convince [Russian President] Vladimir Putin to end his war of territorial aggression"". Moscow has also said that it would welcome the six presidents and is ready to listen with great attention to any proposals that will contribute to resolving the situation in Ukraine.

The West claims that this is the only plan that is currently on the table and which it supports, Lavrov said, noting that Zelensky has repeatedly declined to hold any talks with Moscow and has officially outlawed negotiations with Russia so long as Vladimir Putin remains president.

"20 May, 2023",Nobody in the Muslim world supports sanctions on Russia deputy PM,"The Islamic nations want more trade with Moscow, Marat Khusnullin told RT Islamic countries do not support the West s sanctions on Russia, and the agreements signed at this week s Kazan economic forum prove this, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin told RT on Saturday. Bringing together delegations from Russia and the countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Russia-Islamic World forum in the city of Kazan resulted in hundreds of meetings and more than 100 trade agreements being signed, Khusnullin said. The forum has become a place where political and economic interests have gathered, because the countries of the Muslim world support us, he stated. None of the countries of the Muslim world support sanctions against us. While a handful of Arab nations most notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt formally condemned Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, no Islamic nation has followed the West s lead and imposed economic sanctions on Moscow. Trade between the Islamic world and Russia has continued largely unimpeded, and Khusnullin revealed that more deals are in the works, including bilateral agreements on agricultural products and Halal food, crude oil processing, and banking. Increased trade will be facilitated by the construction of the International North South Transport Corridor, a 7,200-kilometer span of ship, rail, and road routes for moving cargo between India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe. Moving freight from Russia to India is quicker and cheaper than via the traditional Suez Canal route, while eliminating the risk posed by EU sanctions. A lot of ground has been covered here, Khusnullin said. People have exchanged connections, questions, and contacts, and this will give more and more momentum for the future. This year s Kazan forum took place at a time of upheaval in the Islamic world. Aside from the broad refusal to join the West s sanctions regime, the oil-producing Gulf states have refused to increase production at the US request, Saudi Arabia and Iran have resumed diplomatic relations after Chinese-brokered talks, and Syria has been welcomed back into the Arab League amid protests from the West.

"20 May, 2023",Sudanese nationals stranded after US destroys passports media,"The American Embassy shredded the passports of visa applicants before it abandoned its building in Khartoum When US diplomats evacuated their embassy in Khartoum, they destroyed the passports of Sudanese and other third country nationals who were in the process of applying for American visas, the Middle East Eye reported on Friday. With fighting raging in the capital, those without passports are now unable to escape the carnage. The US State Department pulled its diplomats from Sudan and shut its embassy in Khartoum last month, shortly after armed conflict broke out between Sudanese government forces and Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries. A State Department spokesperson told theMiddle East Eyethat embassy staff destroyed documents and materials including passports belonging to Sudanese citizens before the pullout. Our Embassy in Khartoum had passports of Sudanese and other third-country nationals who were in the process of applying for visas and passports of US citizens applying for consular services, the spokesperson said. Because the security environment did not allow us to safely return those passports, we followed our procedure to destroy them rather than leave them behind unsecured. The owners of these passports were left in a vulnerable position. A Sudanese software engineer who was due to start a university program in Iowa in May had already received his visa when fighting broke out, but his passport had not been returned. The student told the Middle East Eye that he planned on fleeing north to Egypt and journeying on to the US from there, but could not do so without his passport. The student was told by the US authorities that he could have an old passport renewed, but he did not have an old passport. I couldn t start my studies and now after destroying the passport, I can t even leave my country to stay in a safe place, he said. Another student who had been accepted to the US told a similar story, saying that his passport had been held at the embassy since January. At present, the only place where the Sudanese government may be issuing new passports and travel documents is at the border with Egypt, the State Department spokesperson said. A week after the embassy closed, the US began evacuating American citizens, locally employed staffers, and people from allied countries from Sudan to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Other nations, including France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and Saudi Arabia, all removed thousands of their citizens from Sudan in late April. The conflict in Sudan entered its second month this week, despite US-brokered talks continuing in Jeddah.

Speaking this week on the sidelines of Russia s International Economic Forum in the city of Kazan, Jaafari said that Moscow and Muslim nations should send what he called a crystal-clear political message about this shared vision, as it is urgent for the world to hear this. Statements by the participants of the Russia-Islamic World forum which hosted over 7,000 attendees from 85 nations only strengthened this view, he added. I heard today such beautiful and fruitful and very interesting statements coming from here and there, from the participants, he said, calling for a formal political declaration to be signed by Russian and Islamic leaders. Jaafari did not say what the document would include, but explained that the existing model of international relations needs to change soon. The world needs to quickly move from the unipolar system to the multipolar system, he said, calling for more balance and more justice. Enough sanctions, invasions, overthrown governments, the ambassador said, suggesting that people are fed up with the belligerent foreign policy of Washington and its allies. Enough is enough. The envoy accused the US of pursuing hypocritical policies, saying Washington supports Syria s territorial integrity and independence in name only when voting at the UN Security Council, while still occupying parts of its territory. In addition to targeting Damascus with sanctions, they steal our oil and gas, and our wheat harvest, causing huge economic damage to our nation, Jaafari said. He also praised what he called the century-long history of relations between Syria and Russia, ties that go beyond the strategic level. Earlier this month, Syria was invited back into the Arab League after a 12-year suspension from the organization. The decision followed a high-level meeting in Amman between Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq, where all parties vowed to support Syria and its institutions to establish control over all of its territory and impose the rule of law.

Images of the covert files initially appeared on the messaging app Discord in January, but went unnoticed until March. Discord later put out an officialstatementcondemning the leak. The documents consist of an elaborate timeline, dozens of military acronyms, including some items marked top secret, which give a detailed picture of the conflict in Ukraine, raging since February 24, 2022. Top secret is the highest level of classification. Some documents also contain the marking NOFORN, or Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals, meaning they cannot be shared with foreign intelligence agencies, including the Five Eyes alliance the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand accordingto the New York Times. Consider the documents take on India, which has been keeping its distance regarding the Ukraine conflict, and refusing to condemn its traditional ally Russia s actions on global forums, including the United Nations (UN). The leak claims that the US influence on New Delhi is on the wane. India s stance echoes those of other emerging powers such as Brazil and Egypt, amid Washington s face-off with Russia and China. The US no longer reserves the bragging rights of an unchallenged superpower as far as India is concerned, while Washington pursues a unilateral hegemonic agenda. India, which is emerging as a leading voice of the Global South, is consistently steering clear of Washington s foreign policy diktats. The Pentagon reportillustratesthat India has no intention of taking sides in the standoff over Ukraine, as New Delhi s actions have demonstrated. India s consistent outreach towards Russia despite growing US pressure cameto the fore during National Security Advisor Ajit Doval s visit to Moscow in February, the leaks revealed. Doval met his Russian counterpart Nikolai Patrushev on February 22, and assured him of New Delhi s support for Russia in multilateral venues . Doval purportedly told Patrushev that India was working to ensure the Ukraine conflict would not come up in talks during the G20 foreign ministers meeting in New Delhi on March 1 and 2, despite considerable pressure to for the issue to be raised (India holds the rotating presidency of G20 and the summit will be held in New Delhi on September 9 and 10). Doval also told Patrushev that India would not deviate from the principled position it had taken in the past. India has been reluctant to invite Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to the G20 summit, despite Kiev s relentless efforts to get him on the elite globalistlist. Besides, Russia-India ties havegaineda new lease of life through growing trade. India and China have emerged as two biggest importers of Russian seaborne crudeoil, breaking historical records, and cocking a snook at US-led sanctions. The leak has also shown that the US is a flagrant offender when it comes to eavesdropping on its key allies such as South Korea, the UAE, Israel and Ukraine, much to Kiev sdisappointment. Leading economies from China and India to South America and the Arab world s most populous nations Brazil and Egypt, along with Russia were all also in the crosshairs of US snooping. The US appears to have hit a stumbling block in its attempts to punish Russia for the Ukraine conflict, resist China s growing maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific, and to take an aggressive stance against authoritarian regimes. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials have admitted that the documents are real. The FBI swung into action andarrestedJack Teixeira, a 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardmember.

The West claims that this is the only plan that is currently on the table and which it supports, Lavrov surmised, noting that Zelensky has repeatedly declined to hold any talks with Moscow and has officially outlawed negotiations with Russia so long as Putin remains president.

"17 May, 2023",Russia still open to diplomacy on Ukraine Lavrov,"The foreign minister said Moscow is prepared to listen to peace proposals by Latin American and African friends Russia is willing to consider proposals by Latin American and African countries to end the Ukraine conflict, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. His remarks came after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Ukraine and Russia had both signaled readiness to host a peace mission of African leaders. Speaking during a joint press conference with Belarusian counterpart Sergey Aleynik on Wednesday, Lavrov said: We have replied to Latin American and African friends that we are ready to consider any of their proposals which are based on a genuine wish to contribute to the stabilization of the world order. The Russian foreign minister noted that Moscow had not yet received anything on paper from Brazil or African states. South African leader Ramaphosa revealed on Tuesday that he had held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Vladimir Zelensky, and that they were both ready to receive the African leaders and to have a discussion on how this conflict can be brought to an end. According to Ramaphosa, the leaders of Senegal, Uganda, and Egypt had agreed to participate in the initiative. Last Saturday, Zelensky rejected Pope Francis offer to help negotiate an end to the conflict with Moscow. With all due respect to His Holiness, we don t need mediators, we need a just peace, the Ukrainian leader told the Italian media, insisting that you can t mediate with Putin. Speaking to Spain s El Pa√≠s newspaper earlier this month, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he believed that peace negotiations are not possible at this time. Since Russia launched its military campaign against Ukraine last February, several nations, including China, Brazil, and Turkiye, have offered assistance as mediators. Turkish-brokered talks in the opening stages of the conflict appeared to be on the verge of agreeing a truce. However, Ukraine pulled out in early April 2022 after discovering what it claimed was evidence of Russian war crimes in the suburbs of Kiev. Moscow has denied those allegations, and has accused the US and UK of derailing the negotiations. Kiev has since produced a ten-point peace plan that calls for the withdrawal of Russian forces from all territories within Ukraine s 1991 borders. Ukraine also insists on Russia paying reparations and surrendering its officials to face war crimes tribunals. The Kremlin has dismissed the plan as unacceptable and ignoring the reality on the ground. ",https://www.rt.com/russia/576455-lavrov-russia-open-diplomacy-ukraine/
"16 May, 2023","Putin, Zelensky open to African peace mission South Africa","An initiative involving heads of state from Egypt, Uganda and Senegal has been proposed to Moscow and Kiev Russia and Ukraine have agreed to host a peace mission from African leaders who are seeking to resolve the conflict between the two nations, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said. During a press briefing on Tuesday, Ramaphosa revealed he had talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky about the proposal. My discussions with the two leaders demonstrated that they are both ready to receive the African leaders and to have a discussion on how this conflict can be brought to an end, Ramaphosa said, as cited by Reuters. Whether that will succeed or not is going to depend on the discussions that will be held, he added. South Africa, which is part of the BRICS group of nations along with Brazil, Russia, India, and China, is among the countries that have refused to join the US-led campaign to sanction Moscow in response to the hostilities in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ramaphosa noted that South Africa had a tradition of non-alignment stemming from the Cold War. Throughout, we have been firm on this point: South Africa has not been, and will not be, drawn into a contest between global powers, the president said. In his announcement on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said the leaders of Senegal, Uganda, and Egypt had agreed to participate in the initiative. The UN secretary general, the US, and the UK had all been briefed on the idea, the South African leader added. Several nations, including China, Brazil, and Turkiye, have offered assistance as mediators between Moscow and Kiev. However, Ukraine and its Western backers have insisted that Zelensky s peace plan is the only viable path to resolve the conflict. The Ukrainian proposal, which has been firmly rejected by Moscow, boils down to Russia conceding defeat, withdrawing from territories Kiev claims as its own, and paying reparations. Ukraine also envisages assistance from the international community for reconstruction and security. The Russian government perceives the conflict in Ukraine as part of a wider proxy war waged against it by the US and its allies, as they seek to protect their hegemony from an emerging multipolar world. Moscow has accused Washington and London of derailing Ankara-mediated peace talks with Kiev, which took place in the first months of the conflict and appeared to be on the verge of agreeing a truce.

"15 May, 2023",Only US should be worried by Syria s Arab League reunion China,"Washington has opposed any reconciliation between Damascus and its neighbors, Beijing claims The Arab League s decision this month to readmit Syria after a nearly 12-year absence should be seen as a positive development by every nation other than the US, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has claimed, arguing that the reconciliation signals the waning of Washington s power in the region. From whatever angle, Syria s return to the Arab League is something to be happy about except for a certain country, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Monday in a press briefing in Beijing. He added that US officials unabashedly criticized the move and pressured allies not to normalize relations with Syria. In fact, it is because of the US pressure and sanctions that Syria has suffered 12 years of war with related catastrophic consequences lasting until now. Arab League foreign ministers last week agreed to readmit Syria, ending a suspension that began in 2011, when Damascus refused to accept the group s plan to end a civil war in the country. Some of the nations that joined the US in pushing for regime change in Syria have taken steps to reconcile with President Bashar al-Assad s government in recent months. The war has displaced more than 13 million people and killed around 300,000. The lifting of Syria s Arab League suspension will bring greater peace and stability to the Middle East and will serve the long-term interests of Arab states, Wang said. The US and a handful of countries call their way of playing the game the rules and regime change in other countries spring. And [they] condemn every action that does not serve their selfish hegemonic interests. This kind of twisted political correctness will not get them anywhere anymore. Syria s return to the Arab League once again proves that when the shadow of the US shrinks, the light of peace spreads. Assad s forces have regained control of about two-thirds of Syria in recent years, defeating US-backed rebels and foreign fighters with the help of Russia and Iran. US forces have illegally occupied oil-rich areas of northeastern Syria since 2014, violating the country s sovereignty. The Arab League s decision to reinstate Syria comes two months after China brokered an agreement to restore diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose bitter rivalry has underpinned geopolitical tensions in the region for decades. Former White House National Security AdviserJohn Bolton, among other observers, has argued that the deal demonstrates diminishing US influence around the world.

"14 May, 2023",Iran and Egypt to restore diplomatic ties,"A senior lawmaker in Tehran has revealed that talks are underway in Iraq Iran and Egypt are on track to restore diplomatic relations and reopen their respective embassies, a member of the Iranian Parliament s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission has said. MP Fada-Hossein Maleki added that President Ebrahim Raisi and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, will meet in person in the near future. Speaking to Iran s Tasnim news agency on Sunday, Maleki said that talks between Tehran and Cairo are currently being held in Iraq. The lawmaker described the atmosphere during the negotiations as positive. In January, the Iranian Foreign Ministry revealed that its head, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, sat down with the Egyptian head of state in late 2022. The ministry spokesperson said at the time that the two countries have basically no problem for dialogue, meetings, and exchange of views. Relations between Cairo and Tehran were severed in 1980 following the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Meanwhile, in mid-March, longstanding rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia announced they were planning to restore diplomatic relations, which they broke off in 2016. The talks and subsequent accord between the two regional powers was brokered by China, with the US conspicuously absent from the affair. The fact that Beijing managed to get the two rivals to talk and reach an agreement was heralded as a major victory for Chinese diplomacy. Riyadh also engaged in negotiations with the Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen last month, giving rise to hopes that the bloody conflict, which has been raging since 2015, may soon come to an end. The war in Yemen is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Late last month, Chinese newspaper the People s Daily reported that President Xi Jinping personally played a pivotal role in persuading Riyadh and Tehran to normalize relations.

"12 May, 2023",Record number of migrants crossing Mediterranean,"Crossings soared almost 300% in the first four months of 2023, the EU s border agency has claimed The number of illegal immigrants attempting the central Mediterranean route into the EU rose to a record 42,165 in the first four months of this year, according to the bloc s border security agency, Frontex. The agency blamed the rise on competition between human traffickers pushing down the price of a crossing. The figure of 42,165 represents a 300% increase on the same period in 2022, with more than half of all illegal immigrants entering the EU now taking the central Mediterranean route an often perilous journey from Libya or Tunisia to Italy or Malta. I ve never seen this before, Frontex chief Hans Leijtens told France s AFP news agency on Friday.""Especially from Tunisia, right now we see, compared with last year, it's a 1,100 percent growth. Leijtens said that the rise has been fueled by increasingly organized human traffickers using makeshift metal boats that can be produced from just over $1,000 and assembled in a day on a Libyan beach. The lower price of the boats, coupled with competition among rival trafficking gangs, has driven down the cost of a trip. ""The lower prices mean they need to have larger volumes. So there's a reason for them to push more, he added. So that may also be an explanation for the numbers right now."" During the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, most of those traveling to the EU came from Syria and the Middle East. In 2023, the top five countries of origin are Ivory Coast, Guinea, Egypt, unknown nations, and Pakistan. There are currently no armed conflicts in any of these countries. While human rights groups have accused Frontex of illegally pushing back migrant boats, Leijtens denied the claims, saying that his agency sometimes allows the Libyan Coast Guard to take these vessels back to shore, which is something completely different. A number of EU countries, including Austria and Greece, havedemandedthat the bloc do more to fortify its external borders against illegal entry, after last year saw the highest number of illegal immigration attempts since 2016. More than 80% of attempted entries were made by adult men. ",https://www.rt.com/news/576200-eu-record-migrants-mediterranean/
"12 May, 2023",Egypt ignored US requests to block Russian flights media,"Washington has been trying to fence in Russian military planes, but Al Sisi s government isn t playing ball, the Wall Street Journal reported Egypt has ignored US requests that it close its airspace to Russian military flights, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. This airspace is a vital corridor between Russia and its military bases in Syria. Multiple American officials asked Cairo in February and March to declare its skies off limits to Russian military aircraft, the newspaperreported, citing US and Egyptian officials. Egypt has not responded to these requests, and flights between Syria and Russia have reportedly continued unimpeded. Asked by the Wall Street Journal, a US State Department official declined to comment on private diplomatic conversations. Situated on Syria s Mediterranean coast, Khmeimim Air Base is one of Russia s most important military facilities in Syria. With Iraq, Jordan, and Turkiye blocking most Russian military flights since last year at the US request, Russian aircraft must now fly south over Azerbaijan and Iran, west over Saudi Arabia, and finally back north over Egypt before landing at Khmeimim. Without permission to fly over Egypt, Russia would be forced to seek a new and far longer route over Africa to reach its forces in Syria by air. Meanwhile, Turkiye s closure of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to military vessels last year has complicated the movement of arms and equipment by sea. American officials believe that Moscow is moving weapons from Syria to the battlefield in Ukraine, although this has not been confirmed or denied by the Russian side. Discounting Ukraine, Egypt is the second-largest recipient of US military aid in the world, receiving about $1.3 billion a year from Washington. Despite only Israel receiving more direct military support from the US, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has not completely aligned his foreign policy with that of Washington. Al Sisi has deployed troops in Libya and ordered airstrikes against the US-recognized Government of National Accord, all while funding the opposing Libyan National Army, which was aided on the battlefield by Russian military contractors. The Egyptian president has a cordial relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the country has adopted a neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine. According to recently leaked Pentagon documents, however, Al Sisi recentlydroppeda plan to supply arms to Russia and instead agreed to supply the US with artillery ammunition for Kiev s forces. The decision was made following what the Washington Post termed a diplomatic offensive from Washington. ",https://www.rt.com/news/576196-egypt-russia-flights-syria/
"12 May, 2023",Vatican recognizes Copts beheaded by Islamic State as martyrs,"Adding members of the Orthodox religion to the list of those who have died for their faith is a sign of communion between the two churches, the Pontiff said Pope Francis has said that 21 Coptic Orthodox Christians beheaded by Islamic State in Libya in 2015 will be considered martyrs by the Catholic Church. The Pontiff made the announcement on Thursday during a meeting at the Vatican with Pope Tawadros II, head of the Egypt-based Coptic Orthodox Church, which has an estimated 10 million followers in North Africa and the Middle East. Pope Francis said the inclusion of the slain Copts in the Roman Martyrology had been decided with the consent of Pope Tawadros, and that it was a sign of the spiritual communion that unites our two Churches. These martyrs were baptized not only with water and the Spirit, but also in blood, in a blood that is the seed of unity for all followers of Christ, the Pontiff said. The execution of the group of Copts, 20 of whom were from Egypt and one from Ghana, took place on February 15, 2015 at a beach in the Libyan city of Sirte. Footage of the beheadings shared by the extremists online showed the men dressed in orange jumpsuits and praying as they were killed. Their bodies were exhumed in 2018 and brought to a shrine in the Egyptian settlement of El-Aour, from where most of them hailed. It is not the first time non-Catholic Christians have been added to the Roman Martyrology (the list of saints celebrated liturgically in the Catholic Church). In 2001, several Orthodox saints were added, including Sergius of Radonezh and Stephen of Perm, who are revered by the Russian Orthodox Church.

It s a matter we must discuss and discuss properly, Naledi Pandor said in an interview in Cape Town on Tuesday. The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Talk of de-dollarization has emerged from governments keen to reduce their reliance on the US currency. The dollar has increased in value due to US interest rate hikes as well as geopolitical conflicts that have negatively impacted most emerging markets. According to Pandor, BRICS nations and other countries are questioning why they are committed to trading through the dollar and can t use their own currencies instead. South Africa has an internationally traded currency, Pandor pointed out, but cautioned that her country also holds significant debt in dollars, so you know we have to approach this discussion responsibly. The minister warned that de-dollarization would be complex and that there would be no guarantee of success. I don t think we should always assume the idea will work, because economics is very difficult and you have to have regard to all countries, especially in a situation of low growth when you are emerging from crises, Pandor told Bloomberg. The BRICS group makes up 40% of the world s population and almost a third of the global economy. According to estimates provided by the South African government, the bloc brings together about 3.2 billion people. Last month, 19 countries reportedly expressed interest in joining the BRICS group, which is gearing up to hold its 15th annual summit in South Africa from August 22 to 24.

"12 May, 2023",US lawmakers threaten sanctions for Syria rapprochement,"Nations normalizing relations with Damascus face severe costs under a newly-introduced bill A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has introduced a bill to oppose the normalization of relations between Syria and other nations. The Arab League reinstated the country this month, while Saudi Arabia announced the reopening of diplomatic channels with Damascus after ten years. The Assad Anti-Normalization Act threatens governments considering normalization with the Assad regime with severe consequences, according to a press release by the office of US Representative Joe Wilson, the primary sponsor of the bill. The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad faced mass protests and an armed uprising over a decade ago. The US and its allies accused Damascus of crimes against its people and backed anti-government forces by sending weapons to militant groups, among other measures. Some of the arms ended up in the hands of outright jihadists. The Syrian government turned the tide of the conflict against the militant groups which had taken over large parts of Syrian territory with the help of Russia and Iran, and is now in control of most parts of the country. The US now has a military base in the east, in spite of objections from Damascus, and supports the Kurdish forces which hold fertile and oil-rich regions of the country. After the opposition s failure to topple Assad, Washington introduced severe economic sanctions, which critics say significantly undermine Syria s attempts at reconstruction. The new legislation seeks to bolster the sanctions. Among other things, it targets foreign airports receiving Syrian planes, seeks to crack down on first lady Asma Assad s charity, and subjects grants of $50,000 or more to Syria from nations in the region to sanctions review. The United States must use all of our leverage to stop normalization with Assad, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said of the new bill, which he co-sponsored. It mandates further sanctions against any form of investment in territory under the control of the Assad regime, as we remain committed to ensuring the Syrian people receive justice. The bill also reacts to the Arab League s reengagement with Syria by instructing the Department of State to monitor and report to the Congress all diplomatic contacts between Damascus and certain states. The list includes Turkiye, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and others. The US government would be required to implement a strategy to counter Syria rapprochement for at least five years under the proposed law. The lawmakers also want to be updated on what they have termed the manipulation of the UN by Damascus, referring to conditions under which UN humanitarian aid programs helping Syrians operate.

"11 May, 2023",Peace efforts falter amid continued violence between Israel and Palestine media,"Heavy fire was traded on Thursday as peace talks mediated by Egypt stalled, according to media reports Attempts to reach a ceasefire between Israel and militant groups in Gaza have so far been unsuccessful, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Thursday, the third day of violent escalation between Israel and Gaza. The worst outbreak of violence in months has already led to the deaths of dozens of Palestinians and one Israeli. Despite our active efforts, these [attempts] have still not brought about the desired results, Shoukry said at a joint press conference with other members of the Munich Group, which also includes France, Germany, and Jordan. Earlier, several media outlets reported that the peace talks mediated by Cairo had stalled. An Israeli source told the broadcaster Kan that Egypt is doing everything it can to stabilize the situation. A Palestinian source told the Turkish Anadolu news agency that the Islamic Jihad group one of the militant factions controlling parts of Gaza linked a potential ceasefire to what it called Israel s assassination policy, referring to Israeli air strikes on Gaza that have killed at least five senior group members since Tuesday, when the violence broke out. Israel made no commitments on that issue, Israeli media reported. The Munich Group issued a joint statement on Thursday, expressing concern over the deteriorating security situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. It also condemned what it called unacceptable civilian casualties, including women and children, in the enclave. France, Germany, Egypt, and Jordan urged an immediate comprehensive ceasefire to end Israeli military operations in Gaza and indiscriminate rocket firing against Israel. The group also said that any unilateral measures undermining the viability of the two state solution must cease, without specifically mentioning Israel s settlement policy in the Occupied West Bank. The EU issued a separate statement on Thursday, in which it largely supported the Munich Group s position and urged for a ceasefire. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered the military on Thursday to take all the measures necessary, prepare additional actions, and maintain readiness for the possibility of increased fire, according to Israeli media. The third day of escalation saw 29 Palestinians killed in Gaza. Rocket fire from the enclave also killed one person in the Israeli city of Rehovot. Five Israelis were injured in rocket attacks across the country. The outbreak of violence was sparked by the death of senior Islamic Jihad member Khader Adnan, who died in Israeli custody earlier this month after an 86-day hunger strike. On Tuesday, the militant group launched a massive rocket barrage at Israel, which responded with air strikes. The Gaza militants have launched a total of 620 rockets since Wednesday, according to AFP. The outbreak of violence is the worst since a brief escalation last August, in which 49 Palestinians were killed, with no deaths in Israel.

"10 May, 2023",Syria and Saudi Arabia reopen embassies,"The move comes just days after Damascus was reinstated to the Arab League, following a decade-long suspension Syria and Saudi Arabia have agreed to resume diplomatic relations nearly 10 years after cutting ties, both countries have announced. The move marks yet another rapprochement between Riyadh and its former foes, after the Gulf kingdom also restored diplomacy with Iran under a deal brokered by China. The Syrian Foreign Ministry confirmed the decision in astatementon Tuesday, saying the renewed diplomacy would strengthen bilateral relations between Arab countries to serve joint Arab action. Based on the deep bonds and common affiliation of the peoples of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the embodiment of the aspirations of the peoples of the two countries The Syrian Arab Republic decided to resume the work of its diplomatic mission in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the ministry said. The Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a similar notice on Tuesday, stressing the brotherhood ties that unite the peoples of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Syrian Arab Republic. While neither country specified when they would reopen their respective embassies, the kingdom added that the move would enhance security and stability in the region. Riyadh initially broke relations with Damascus in 2012, not long after the Syrian war kicked off, during which Saudi Arabia supplied millions of dollars in weapons and gear to jihadist rebel factions seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Saudi officials were among the first to condemn Assad s handling of anti-government protests at the time, later shuttering the Saudi embassy in Syria and expelling the Syrian ambassador. However, following a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran mediated by China in March, the region has seen renewed efforts to mend ties between former adversaries, with the United Arab Emirates also voicing willingness to improve relations with Syria. Tehran and Riyadh have also taken steps to end the conflict in Yemen, which has raged since 2015, taking a devastating toll on Yemeni civilians. On Sunday, the 22-member Arab League agreed to lift Syria s 12-year suspension from the organization, yet another step toward reconciliation. That decision followed a high-level meeting in Amman between Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq, where all parties agreed to improve cooperation on combating terrorism and pledged to support Syria and its institutions to establish control over all of its territory and impose the rule of law.

He also addressed efforts to ensure the safety of Turkish citizens in Sudan and evacuate them from the country, the statement said. Ankara will also continue its efforts in contact with the United Nations to ensure that the urgent humanitarian needs of the Sudanese people are met. While ceasefire talks between the military rivals began on Saturday in Saudi Arabia s coastal city of Jeddah, backed by Washington, a Saudi diplomat told AFP on Monday that the discussions had yielded no major progress.

The UN Refugee Agency is seeking $445 million to provide immediate support for an estimated 860,000 refugees and returnees from Sudan across Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic. Erdogan, who is seeking a third term as president in the May 14 election, has attempted to position Turkiye as a mediator in other conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. In December last year, the Turkish leader criticized the West for making provocations instead of acting as a mediator in the Ukraine conflict and highlighted Turkiye s efforts last year in brokering the Black Sea grain corridor deal.

President Joe Bidenannouncedin January that Kiev would get the US main battle tanks,reportedlyas cover for Germany to relent on sending its own Leopards. The Pentagon initially announced that 31 M1A2 models would be sent. Plans changed by March, however, as the US military opted to refurbish older M1A1 models instead. The lower-tech tanks will not have sensitive technology that Russians could exploit, such as advanced targeting systems for the 120mm main gun, two officials who were not authorized to speak publicly toldUSA Today. The outlet also quoted a RAND Corporation expert, who said Russia could test any captured tanks for vulnerabilities. The 70-ton, gas turbine-powered behemoth was developed in the 1970s and first saw combat in the 1991 Gulf War. Since then, stripped-down export versions have been provided to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, and Australia. Ukrainian troops are scheduled to start training to handle the four-man tanks later this month at US bases in Germany. The training will take about ten weeks. The tanks themselves are expected to arrive later this year, so they will miss Kiev s much-anticipated spring offensive. We re moving as quickly as possible, Colonel Martin O'Donnell, the spokesman for US Army Europe and Africa, told USA Today. It can take years to refurbish a tank for export, he added. Significantly depleted in last year s fighting, Ukraine s armored force was somewhat replenished by T-72 tanks sent by Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia, as well as older T-55s from Slovenia. With those running out as well, Kiev clamored for Western weapons. Biden s Abrams announcement was used to pressure German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to approve the delivery of Leopard 1 and 2 MBTs, first from other NATO members and then by Berlin as well. The UK has also sent 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which it previously prepared to retire. Meanwhile, Russia has deployed some of its most advanced tanks to the Ukrainian battlefield, including the T-90M and theT-14 Armata. ",https://www.rt.com/news/575980-abrams-ukraine-stripped-down/
"7 May, 2023",Arab League reinstates Syria,"The country had been suspended from the body for over a decade The Arab League agreed on Sunday to reinstate Syria s membership of the organization. The move comes ahead of a summit of the League scheduled to take place in Riyadh on May 19. The decision was adopted at a closed-door meeting of the group s top diplomats in Cairo, with representatives of 13 out of the 22 member states in attendance. All of them endorsed the move. Syria was suspended from the Arab League in 2011 in the wake of the civil unrest in the country, part of the broader Arab Spring turmoil in the region, which ultimately sparked civil war. Most Arab nations severed diplomatic ties with Damascus at the time, with some of them openly backing various opponents of Syrian President Bashar Assad. During the years of war, various insurgents emerged in the country, ranging from the so-called moderate opposition militants, backed by different foreign actors, to internationally recognized terrorists, including the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). However, Damascus managed to crush most of them, regaining control over the most densely populated regions of the country with the help of the country s key allies, Russia and Iran. Turkish-backed militants currently hold parts of northern Syria, while US-backed Kurdish militias are in control of the country s northeast, and most of its oil wells remain under direct US military control. Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq held a meeting in Amman at which they adopted a joint statement calling for ending the presence of terrorist organizations as well as armed groups on the territory of Syria. They also called for an end to foreign interference in Syrian domestic affairs and pledged to support Syria and its institutions to establish control over all of its territory and impose the rule of law. In recent weeks, there have been indicators that the years-long conflicts in the region, including in Syria and Yemen, may be nearing their ends thanks to ongoing diplomatic efforts. Last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad made a breakthrough visit to Saudi Arabia, which used to be a leading supporter of the anti-government militants fighting Damascus. After the visit, Riyadh publicly endorsed Syrian unity and integrity and backed a political solution to the 12-year-long war. The development was preceded by a China-mediated agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran to normalize relations, a milestone that apparently contributed to the Syrian rapprochement, as well as facilitating peace talks to end the eight-year-long conflict in Yemen, which has been largely fueled by the rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh.

So far, Rome has managed to partially replace natural gas from Russia with fuel from other suppliers, Descalzi said, adding that some 30 million cubic meters out of 40 million cubic meters have currently been replaced. Completely eliminating imports of Russian gas is not an easy task, Descalzi believes, because Italy hasn t emphasized investment in domestic production for nearly eight years. He said that the partial progress in replacing Russian supplies has been attributable to Italy s historic ties with such nations as Egypt, Angola, Algeria, Congo, Mozambique, as well as in Libya, where Eni has continued operating and produces 70% of the gas for the domestic market. Italy relies on imports for nearly 75% of its energy. In early 2022, it was receiving 40% of its gas from Russia before imports subsequently plunged due to sanctions on Moscow and the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.

"7 May, 2023",Russia expands nuclear project in Egypt,"The project is intended to help the country diversify its energy resources Russian state-owned energy giant Rosatom has begun building a third reactor at the El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Egypt, the company s press service announced this week. The four-reactor El-Dabaa plant is located around 300km northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The project was launched in 2017, and construction works started in 2022. The planned four nuclear reactors for the plant are expected to operate at a full capacity of 4.8 GW by 2030. The construction of Unit 3 commenced this week with the pouring of the first concrete, following the issuance of permits in March by the Egyptian Nuclear and Radiological Regulatory Authority. The project is progressing in accordance with the agreed time schedules and we are here to witness the dedication of the teams who worked towards this common goal, the regulatory authority stated. El-Dabaa will be Egypt s first NPP and the first such facility on the African continent built with Russian technology. It is also the largest joint Russian-Egyptian project since the construction of the Aswan Dam, according to Rosatom. In addition to Rosatom, major Egyptian contractors are also involved in building the plant. The project is jointly financed by Moscow and Cairo. The Russian government is providing 85% of the $30 billion cost in the form of a state loan, while the rest is being funded by Egypt. Under the terms of the deal signed by the two countries, Rosatom will supply nuclear fuel for the plant for its 60-year design lifetime and will carry out maintenance and repairs for ten years after the launch of each reactor.

"3 May, 2023",Iranian president on first visit to Syria since war,"Ebrahim Raisi and Bashar Assad have signaled a rapprochement with a long-term strategic cooperation agreement The presidents of Iran and Syria have signed a long-term strategic cooperation agreement during the first meeting between the two countries leaders since before war broke out over a decade ago, Damascus state news agency, SANA, reported on Wednesday. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with his Syrian counterpart, Bashar Assad, in Damascus on Wednesday to sign multiple memoranda of understanding. The documents covered cooperation between the two countries in oil, communications and information technology, railways, civil aviation, agriculture, and free zones. The leaders also agreed to mutual recognition of maritime certificates and signed a memorandum of understanding between the National Center for Earthquakes in Syria and the International Institute of Seismic Engineering in Iran. Assad and Raisi affirmed their countries shared geopolitical aims and discussed recent political moves in the region. We are currently witnessing many political developments and changes in the region and the world, but relations between the two countries have not and will not be affected by these changes and developments, Raisi promised, praising his host nation for achiev[ing] victory despite the threats and sanctions imposed on you. Iran will be standing side by side with Syria, particularly during the period of reconstruction, he said. The last Iranian head of state to visit Syria was then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2010, though Tehran has provided military and economic assistance to Damascus in the intervening years. While Assad s government was targeted for isolation and destruction by the US and its allies, leading to estrangement from many of its Arab neighbors, regional hostilities have apparently cooled to the point that foreign ministers from Egypt and Saudi Arabia have visited Damascus in recent weeks. America and its allies failed on all fronts against the resistance, and could not achieve any of their goals, Iran s newly-appointed ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbar, told Iranian state media on Tuesday. In a further sign of thawing regional hostilities, in March, Iran and Saudi Arabia reopened their mutual embassies after seven years without official communication, after China hosted a meeting between the countries foreign ministers.

"3 May, 2023",Russian oil shipments up despite production cut Bloomberg,"Moscow has pledged to reduce output by 500,000 barrels a day in response to Western sanctions Aggregate flows of Russian crude jumped to 4.08 million barrels per day (bpd) in the seven days to April 28, despite the Western sanctions and Moscow s output cut, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday citing tanker-tracking data. The exports reportedly exceeded 4 million bpd for only the second time since the start of 2022. According to the report, shipments via the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Pacific were all higher, with flows via the Arctic unchanged from the previous week. The figures excluded volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk, identified as Kazakhstan s KEBCO grade, it said. Bloomberg pointed out that the seaborne flows are still not reflecting a production cut, which according to the Russian Energy Ministry was 700,000 bpd in March. The government earlier pledged to curb output by 500,000 bpd between March and December in retaliation to Western trade restrictions and a price cap imposed by G7 nations. It doesn t appear that refinery runs in Russia have dropped much either, the outlet wrote, noting that the figures show processing rates have remained virtually unchanged from the start of the year and, in the first 19 days of April, were 720,000 bpd higher than the same full month of 2022. Moscow has also stopped publishing crude and condensate production data, which makes it more difficult to assess the output cut, Bloomberg noted. Data showed that Russian crude flows in the week to April 28 surged by about 680,000 bpd from the previous week. The combined volume of crude on vessels heading to China and India, plus smaller flows to Turkiye and quantities on ships that haven t yet shown a final destination, reportedly rose for a third week to reach a record 3.39 million bpd in the latest four-week period. Meanwhile, no Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to April 28, according to the report. Statistics showed that Russia s seaborne crude exports to European countries slid to 63,000 bpd in the 28 days to April 28, with Bulgaria remaining the sole destination. A market that consumed more than 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve, Bloomberg wrote. Russia has been diversifying its energy supplies in response to Western sanctions since the EU stopped accepting the country s oil transported by sea. Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak revealed this week that Moscow will reroute more than 60% of its oil and petroleum products exports from the EU to Asia this year. According to Novak, of the 220 million tons of crude and refined products previously destined for the EU, Russia will reorient 140 million tons to Asia. According to the report, the equivalent of 720,000 bpd was carried on vessels showing destinations as either Port Said or Suez in Egypt, or which already have been or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India or China and show up in the chart below as Unknown Asia until a final destination becomes apparent, it said. Russia and India are currently discussing the creation of joint re-insurance institutes for oil shipments, according to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov, who said such entities could be set up before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Novak has stated that Russia needs new insurance and reinsurance mechanisms for its oil exports. ",https://www.rt.com/business/575696-russian-oil-shipments-sanctions/
"3 May, 2023",Can Eurasia s rising political bloc show a united front against the West s encroachment?,"The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is growing, but must balance the conflicting agendas of individual members ByKanwal Sibal, retired Indian foreign secretary and former Ambassador to Russia between 2004 and 2007. He also held ambassadorial positions in Turkey, Egypt, France and wasDeputy Chief of Mission in Washington DC. ByKanwal Sibal, retired Indian foreign secretary and former Ambassador to Russia between 2004 and 2007. He also held ambassadorial positions in Turkey, Egypt, France and wasDeputy Chief of Mission in Washington DC. India, the current chair of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), will host the two-day Foreign Ministers meeting on May 4 in Goa, on the heels of a Defence Ministers meeting in New Delhi on April 27-28. The bloc continues to enlarge, bringing optimism to the members, but as new countries are added, new challenges within the group arise. A Eurasian political, economic, international security and defense organization, the SCO is the largest bloc in the world in terms of territory and population. It was established in 2001 by China, Russia, and four Central Asian states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India is not an original member and only attained full membership in 2017. Russia has had very close ties historically with India and was supportive of New Delhi s membership early after the SCO s establishment. It was a practical move following the Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue platform Moscow already set up in 2002. India s inclusion in the SCO was a natural political extension of the logic of RIC as a non-Western grouping opposed to US unilateralism towards Central Asia as a whole. However, China insisted on linking India s membership with that of Pakistan, whose membership in the SCO at that time seemed problematic. Some concerns may have existed regarding the potential spillover of India-Pakistan tensions into the SCO, but eventually, both India and Pakistan joined simultaneously in 2017. Iran, bordering the Central Asian states and with close historical links with many of them, would have been a natural partner, but SCO members were reluctant to risk the organization getting entangled in nuclear proliferation issues surrounding Iran. Complications would have arisen from the UN Security Council sanctions imposed on Tehran approved by Russia and China asP5members with non-proliferation commitments. Given the sharp deterioration of US ties with Russia and China, the geopolitical scenario has dramatically changed, removing earlier reservations, and now Iran is set to become a full member of the SCO this year. The organization is a vehicle for the larger Eurasian region to capitalize on cooperative opportunities and address challenges autonomously from the West in a variety of spheres, including trade and economy, science and technology, energy, transportation, culture, education, and more. The West has dominated the international system for a few centuries, and the post-1945 global order reflects its hegemony. Despite the ongoing dispersion of political, economic and military power towards the East, the West still seeks to shape the changing global environment to its advantage by strengthening military alliances, military interventions, weaponizing its financial power through the reserve currency status of the US dollar, sanctions, extraterritorial application of its domestic legislation, and interference in the internal affairs of countries to promote human rights and democracies on a selective basis. In contrast, the declared goal of the SCO is to strengthen mutual confidence and neighborly relations among the member countries to maintain and ensure peace, security and stability in the region and move towards the establishment of a new, democratic, just and rational political and economic international order. Principles of mutual trust and benefit, equal rights, consultations, respect for the diversity of cultures and aspiration towards common development guide its functioning. The SCO also seeks to combat international drug trafficking as a source of financing global terrorism with a focus on Afghanistan in particular. The SCO, along with BRICS, is a building block for a multipolar global system. That goal is being advanced with more countries seeking links with it. Four countries Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran and Mongolia have observer status, and nine countries Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cambodia, Nepal, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar have dialogue partner status. A political balance is being maintained between Russia and China within the expanded adherents to the SCO. Moscow has interests with many of these countries such as Azerbaijan and Armenia (in conflict with each other with Russia trying to maintain peace) as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia with which Russia has either close defense ties or energy coordination. Additionally, Turkey, a NATO member, is closely engaged with Russia in many areas and has an active presence in Azerbaijan and Central Asia. It has been sponsoring peace conferences in Afghanistan and Belarus as well as Mongolia. Outside its extensive ties to all the core members of the SCO, China has enhanced interests in Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Qatar. Observer status for Afghanistan is logical based on its geographical location, despite concerns regarding its instability, conflicts, and subsequent overflow into neighboring countries. India has stakes in the SCO for various reasons. It is a major Asian country, comparable to China in many dimensions, has historical connections and affinities with Central Asian countries, and New Delhi s leaders have maintained close contacts with these countries since their independence. India s rising economy can contribute to their economic growth and help balance their external ties with various power centers. Terrorism and religious extremism is a shared concern, but India is interested in regional connectivity projects linking it with this region. As a result, India has vital security interests in Afghanistan and must consult regularly with SCO members about the evolution of the situation there. Finally, India seeks to counter Pakistan s efforts to prevent closer links between India and Central Asia. As in the case of other international organizations, there is a gap between the purpose and practice in the SCO. The organization has extensive guidelines on peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-use of force or threats to use force, no military superiority in adjacent areas, counteracting terrorism, extremism and separatism in all its manifestations, etc. Despite these expressed SCO values, India and China are locked in disputes of territorial sovereignty and similar issues bedevil India-Pakistan ties as well. A large number of Chinese troops are currently massed on the Indian border contrary to past agreements, clashes have taken place and the danger of escalation exists. Meanwhile, India accuses Pakistan of nurturing jihadi groups and promoting cross-border terrorism. The reality of international life and differences between states necessitates consistent efforts to address conflicting interests and find common ground where goals do not clash. The SCO provides a platform to achieve this, and the upcoming foreign ministers meeting under India s chairmanship will hopefully advance the collective aims of participating countries amidst an international environment that is becoming more disruptive and confrontational.",https://www.rt.com/india/575633-sco-eurasia-political-bloc/
"2 May, 2023","The US grip on the Middle East slips, and peace breaks out","Washington s poor decision-making is starting to catch up with it, as nations choose to pursue peace without American interference Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . As Washington s influence in the Middle East declines, countries throughout the region are taking to compromise, rapprochement, and peace talks, inflicting a blow to the US narrative that seeks to depict its role as a stabilizer and democracy advocate. Under the leadership of US President Joe Biden, there has been a notable downgrade in the status of the West amongst various long-time Middle East allies. As the US-led West exerts the majority of its efforts on the war in Ukraine, its poor decision making in the Middle East has finally begun to catch up to it. The first major blow to Washington s influence came in the form of aChinese-mediated agreementto end a decades-long feud between major regional actors Iran and Saudi Arabia, one which led to the severing of ties in 2016. This has a number of implications for US power in the region. The first being that this collapsed a strategy that the US was developing, to unite Saudi Arabia with the likes of Egypt, the UAE, Jordan, Bahrain, and Israel, against Iran and its allies in the region; the alliance was speculated to serve as a Middle East NATO. The second is that the Iran-Saudi rapprochement appears to have caused Riyadh to scrap its plans for normalizing ties with Israel at this time, something that the Biden administration clearly values as a foreign policy achievement. There is also the additional aspect of this being negotiated by Beijing without any regard for how it would reflect on the White House. Despite attempts in Washington to make the deal seem like something it approves of, and repeated remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how close normalization with Saudi Arabia is, it was clearly a blow and has major consequences to the US approach to the region. In March, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salmansaidthat he didn t care if the US President had misunderstood things about him, and later in April it was reported he also told advisors that pleasing the Americans is no longer apriority. Immediately after the Saudi-Iran normalization, Riyadh entered into serious negotiations with Yemen s Ansarallah (the Houthis), in order to end the war that has been raging between the two sides since 2015 and has claimed around 400,000 lives in the country. To make things worse for the US, Saudi Arabia s foreign minister recently made a trip to Damascus to meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In addition to Riyadh s moves and Tunisia re-establishing ties with Syria, it also appears as if Ankara may be on the cusp of rapprochement with Damascus and there is a push for Syria to be re-integrated into the Arab League, which clearly runs contrary to the US agenda. Then we have the fact that Qatar has announced it is restoring ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which is not as significant as the above mentioned moves, yet adds to a list of peacemaking decisions taken without America. On the level of optics, this makes it seem as if the common denominator is the absence of the US. On the other hand, Washington s development of ties with the Kingdom of Morocco is egging on tensions with neighboring Algeria. Not only is the Biden administration adding fuel to the fire in the diplomatic feud between both sides, but is helping exacerbate military tensions in a Rabat-Algiers arms race. Earlier this April, the US approved a potential$524.2 million saleof HIMARS artillery rocket systems to Morocco. Furthermore, the top Middle East partner of the United States, Israel, has been severely weakened by an ongoing domestic political crisis over a proposed judicial overhaul by the Israeli government. Problems have also arisen with Israel s approach to issues like maintaining the status quo at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a holy site where neighboring Jordan maintains custodianship, and it has caused major rows between Amman and Tel Aviv in recent months. This presents another obstacle to the US, which is being forced to mediate between both sides to maintain calm. Another layer is thefeud between Biden and Netanyahu, which has called into question the special relationship between Israel and the US for the first time since the 1950s. The US strategy in the Middle East has been to impose its dominance, primarily through the military sphere. Its selling points have been security, weapons sales, threats of military action against foes, and the creation of a Sunni-Shia cold war that pitted Iran and Saudi Arabia against one another. The strength of Iran s weapons programs, along with its regional alliances, has largely left the US incapable of maintaining a military edge that severely outweighs the power of its opposition. The American overstretch in the region has seen it driven from Afghanistan in an embarrassing fashion and rendered it incapable of protecting its allies from the damage of potential missile strikes from Iran and its allies. Washington actively builds relationships based upon strategies that put its own partners in the firing line, but where air defense systems it sells to them do not provide enough protection. Even when it comes to the Palestine-Israel conflict, an issue wedded to the US since 1967, US leadership is waning. Earlier this week, China s foreign minister, Qin Gang,proposedto his Palestinian Authority and Israeli counterparts that Beijing step in to facilitate dialogue between the two sides. Although the conflict is not going to be solved overnight, the mere fact that another world power is stepping into the arena will certainly send a message to American policy makers. Instead of engaging the region as equals, looking for economic partnerships that are mutually beneficial, the US has used its military might to divide and conquer, inflicting millions of deaths and spending trillions of dollars in the process. This may have succeeded in the past, but America s ability to wage regime change wars has been severely curtailed. The main US enemies, Iran and its allies, have made significant leaps in the military field, making direct war increasingly unfeasible, and has even pressured Tehran s former adversaries to rethink their strategies. Although we are only at the beginning of this new phase in the Middle East, it is clear that poor policy decisions and the inability of Washington to envisage a way forward are pushing away key allies, and this time for the better.",https://www.rt.com/news/575328-middle-east-us-interference/

Jordan hosted the meeting, the first of its kind since Syria s membership in the Arab League was suspended in 2011. Prior to the multilateral meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad met with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi to discuss refugees, border security and water issues, according to Amman. In a joint statement distributed by state news agencies, the five ministers called for ending the presence of terrorist organizations as well as armed groups on the territory of Syria, and neutralizing their ability to threaten regional and international security. They also pledged to support Syria and its institutions to establish control over all of its territory and impose the rule of law. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq pledged to establish ties with the Syrian military and security institutions in order to address security challenges. The five ministers also called for stopping foreign interference in Syrian domestic affairs. Their joint declaration also called for setting up technical teams of experts that would follow up on the summit and implement practical measures to resolve the conflict in Syria. The Amman meeting comes just weeks after Mekdad visited Saudi Arabia and received the kingdom s endorsement for Syria s territorial integrity. Currently, Turkish-backed militants control parts of northern Syria, while the northeast is under the control of US-backed Kurdish militias. Several hundred US soldiers are also in Syria, controlling most of the country s oil wells.

"25 Apr, 2023",Biohazard risk in Sudan as warring faction seizes lab WHO,"Technicians have been denied entry to a facility where samples of diseases are stored, according to an official The World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a potential biological hazard in Sudan on Tuesday, describing an armed faction s seizure of a laboratory holding samples of pathogens including polio and measles as an extremely dangerous situation. There is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab... by one of the fighting parties, Nima Saeed Abid, WHO representative in Sudan, told reporters in Geneva via video link. He said technicians have been thrown out with no accessibility to the lab, and no way to safely contain the biological material and substances available. Nima said at least 459 people have been killed and 4,072 injured in the fighting that broke out on April 15 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The country s capital, Khartoum, and nearby towns have been gripped by nearly two weeks of intense bombardment, causing severe food, water, medicine, and fuel shortages. Doctors Without Borders Operational Manager for Sudan, Abdalla Hussein, told RT on Friday that hospitals in Khartoum and surrounding cities have closed due to heavy shelling. According to the Sudanese Doctors Union, 13 hospitals have been bombed and 19 have been forced to evacuate, six ambulances have been attacked by military forces, and others have been denied passage to transport patients and receive aid since the conflict began. The International Organization for Migration and the World Food Programme suspended their operations in Sudan after some of their employees were killed in the fighting. In areas where intense fighting has hampered our humanitarian operations, we have been forced to reduce our footprint, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, said on Tuesday.

"20 Apr, 2023",US pressuring African state to mend ties with Israel Axios,"Washington has maintained a military presence in Niger for the better part of a decade US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Niger s president to normalize relations with Israel during his trip to Africa in March, according to Axios. The two countries officially severed ties in 2002 over Israeli military action in the Palestinian territories. In talks with Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum last month, Blinken pressed him to move toward normalizing relations with Israel, Axiosreportedon Wednesday, citing two US and Israeli officials. Blinken later briefed Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen on the discussions, the officials said, noting that Cohen proposed inviting Niger to the next Negev Forum, a yearly event involving the US, Israel, and Arab states such as Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. Multiple unnamed Israeli officials also said Niger s leadership is open to warming ties with Israel, but claimed they hoped for deliverables in return from Washington. Though Blinken is the first US secretary of state to visit the country since it gained its independence from France in 1960, Niger is nevertheless a major US security partner in the Sahel a region stretching across Africa south of the Sahara Desert. After investing $110 million to construct a massive drone base in the country in 2016, Washington has continued to pour large sums of security and humanitarian aid into Niger, making it the largest recipient of State Department military assistance in West Africa, according to a departmentfact sheet. US troops have operated in Niger intermittently throughout the War on Terror, and were deployed there under a broad status of forces deal in 2013. During his visit, Blinken announced a $150 million aid package for Sahel nations, including Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso, bringing total US assistance to the region to $233 million in 2023. Relations between Israel and Niger have long been rocky. After cutting ties in 1973, ties warmed in the wake of the 1996 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. However contacts were again cut after renewed Israeli fighting with the Palestinians in 2002. They have kept no formal diplomatic ties since. Israel has normalized relations with several Arab or Muslim-majority states in recent years under the US-brokered Abraham Accords, including Bahrain, the UAE, Sudan, and Morocco. However, some countries in the region, such as Oman, have said they are not ready to resume ties until Israel achieves peace with the Palestinians under a two-state solution, which appears unlikely in the near term asviolencecontinues to grip the occupied territories.

"19 Apr, 2023",Netflix sued for turning Cleopatra black,"Egyptian lawyer Mahmoud al-Semary has sued Netflix over its depiction of the ancient Egyptian leader Cleopatra as black in the forthcoming documentary film Queen Cleopatra . He demanded that the streaming giant be shut down in Egypt in a complaint filed with the Public Prosecutor on Tuesday. Calling for the Netflix production team to be punished for participating in a crime, al-Semary argued that the recently-released trailer flies in the face of Egyptian history and promotes a divisive Afrocentrism. In order to preserve the Egyptian national and cultural identity among Egyptians all over the world there must be pride in the makings of such work, the attorney said, adding that most of Netflix s offerings do not conform to Islamic and societal values and principles, especially Egyptian ones. The complaint also accuses Netflix and the makers of Queen Cleopatra of forgery. Actress Adele James, who portrays the iconic Egyptian queen in the film, vowed to block all detractors on social media after Twitter users accused her of cultural appropriation. Former Egyptian Antiquities Minister Zahi Hawass condemned the production last week for falsifying facts, pointing out that Cleopatra was Greek, meaning that she was blonde, not black. Calling on Egyptians to speak out against Netflix s revisionism, Hawass excoriated the trend that has emerged in some American black populations of claiming the Egyptian civilization actually came from black Africa. Netflix is trying to stir up confusion to spread false information that the origin of Egyptian civilization is black, he said, insisting such claims were categorically false. Egyptian temples from the era depict the civilization s kings as racially distinct from the African, Nubian, Libyan, and Asian enemies they are illustrated in combat with, Hawass pointed out. He explained that Egypt did not fall under the leadership of black Africans until the Kingdom of Kush the 25th dynasty, at the end of the civilization now known as Ancient Egypt. Cleopatra was of Macedonian Greek origin, as were her ancestors, the Ptolemaic dynasty, who had ruled Egypt for nearly three centuries by the time of her reign. All are depicted as black in the documentary. A Change.org petition launched by two Egyptians calling on Netflix to cancel the miniseries for falsifying history attracted over 85,000 signatures in under two days before the platform mysteriously removed it. Produced by actress Jada Pinkett Smith, the film is set to air next month as part of Netflix s African Queens series. ",https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/575014-egyptian-lawyer-sues-netflix-cleopatra/
"19 Apr, 2023",BRICS to surpass G7 in share of global economic growth Bloomberg,"The bloc of developing countries will be a larger driver of development than the Western Group of Seven major economies Members of the BRICS group Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are expected to outpace the US-led G7 in terms of their contribution to the world s economic growth, from this year, Bloomberg reported on Monday. According to the outlet s calculations based on the latest IMF data the BRICS countries will contribute 32.1% of the world s growth, compared to the G7 s 29.9%. The Group of Seven nations (G7) consisting of the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan has long been considered the most advanced economic bloc of countries on the planet. Russia was a member, until 2014, when it was expelled due to the fallout from the Western-backed Maidan coup in Ukraine. The report indicated that in 2020, the contributions from BRICS countries and the G7 to global economic growth were equal. Since then the performance of the Western-led bloc has been declining. By 2028, the G7 s contribution to the world economy is predicted to decrease to 27.8%, while the BRICS will account for 35%. Bloomberg calculations show that China will be the top contributor to global growth over the next five years, with its share set to be double that of the US. China s share of global GDP expansion is expected to represent 22.6% of total world growth by 2028, the outlet wrote. India is projected to contribute 12.9% of global GDP. In total, 75% of global growth is expected to be concentrated in 20 countries and over half in the top four: China, India, the US and Indonesia. While Group of Seven countries will comprise a smaller share, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and France are seen among the top 10 contributors, the outlet wrote. A recent study by a UK-based macroeconomics research firm has also found that the gap between the two groups in terms of global economic weight is expected to continue to grow. The analysts noted that China and India have been experiencing robust economic growth, and more countries are interested in joining BRICS. Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that more than a dozen nations have expressed interest in joining BRICS, including Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bangladesh have acquired equity in the New Development Bank, the funding organization of BRICS.

ByKanwal Sibal, retired Indian foreign secretary and former Ambassador to Russia between 2004 and 2007. He also held ambassadorial positions in Turkey, Egypt, France and wasDeputy Chief of Mission in Washington DC. Multipolarity is a code word for more equitable power sharing in the world. Although global power, especially economic, has been dispersing in recent years, mainly towards the East, it is still not adequately reflected in decision-making on global issues. The West, led by the US, still dominates international political and financial institutions. It seeks to impose its values and norms on others and uses human rights and democracy as tools to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. It has not given up attempts to bring about regime change in other countries to further its geopolitical agenda. It is currently strengthening or building military alliances and partnerships to maintain its global leadership. It tries to shape narratives at the international level in its favor through the global information networks it controls. The power that the US exerts on all transactions in US dollars, along with the status of the US dollar as the world s reserve currency, arms Washington with a unique weapon for financial domination including its use of sanctions as an instrument to bend countries to its strategic goals. All of these deficiencies in global governance are epitomized in the unfolding of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia has been subject to a series of sanctions by the West without UN approval. Third countries are pressured to adhere to them under pain of secondary sanctions by the US. Losing access to the US financial markets is a risk that countries want to avoid. With multiple Russian banks arbitrarily excluded from the SWIFT payments system, bank transfer arrangements with Russia have been disrupted, affecting trade exchanges. Russian foreign exchange reserve holdings abroad have been illegally confiscated. Not only has the West broken oil and gas ties with Russia, other countries have been pressed to do so. A price cap on Russian oil has been imposed in a bid to limit Russian earnings from oil sales. The declared goal of these measures is to cause Russia s economic collapse. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has been blown up to end Germany s reliance on Russian gas. The property of private Russian individuals has been confiscated without due process of law, which casts doubt on the sanctity of private property in Western countries. Russian media has been banned in violation of Europe s commitment to freedom of speech as a fundamental value, and Western media has long been propagating narratives demonizing Russia and its President. The essence of multipolarity is multilateralism. However, the structures of multilateralism have not functioned well in the field of international security in particular and have been weakened further with the absence of reforms in the international political and economic institutions. The UN Security Council, the World Bank and the IMF still reflect the world of 1945 in many ways and require a thorough overhaul and modern restructuring. The UN Security Council needs to be expanded to give more representation to rising developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future with the deepening divisions between the West on one side and Russia and China on the other blocking even further an already difficult consensus from emerging. The expansion of the Security Council, in effect, constitutes a transfer of power at the international level, and this will continue to be resisted by the permanent powers for various reasons. Multilateralism means a willingness to accept the redistribution of global power that has already occurred on the ground, instead of looking for ways to limit its import by strengthening existing alliances and forging new ones, as is being seen today. The transatlantic alliance has been fortified, NATO expansion is taking place, Germany are Japan are rearming, US alliances in Asia are being reinforced, a new AUKUS alliance has been created and the Quad is being deepened as a platform. At the heart of this are the perceived threats from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine conflict, and from China emerging as a rival power economically, politically and militarily as well. Essentially, reinvigorating alliances is meant to constrain the emergence of multipolarity by limiting the growth of independent poles of power and their impact. The attempt is to recognise the shifts in power at the global level but consolidate this shift under the US umbrella as much as possible. The ambition of Europe to nurture an independent role, pushed at one time by France, has effectively been quashed for the time being. Russia, sensing its loss of power after the collapse of the Soviet Union and seeking to build a non-Western front against US unilateralism began a push for a multipolar world. It was prompted by US s promotion of color revolutions, regime changes, and even the break-up of countries to serve geopolitical ends, ostensibly in the name of democracy and human rights. The Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue platform, a concept initiated by former Russian foreign minister Evgeny Primakov back in 1998, was the first step in this direction. The RIC evolved into BRIC with the addition of Brazil and BRICS with the entry of South Africa. This gave a multi-continental base to the concept of multipolarity. BRICS has since been raised to summit level. Its agenda of institutional contacts and promotion of economic and financial cooperation has produced tangible results. Today, many countries seek BRICS membership such as Algeria, Argentina and Iran who have applied, while Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are potential members. Greater connectivity, transport, energy supplies, trade, alternative supply chains, and de-dollarization could all be promoted concretely under the aegis of BRICS. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) led by Russia and China is another forum to promote multipolarity. India is a member and will be hosting the SCO summit this year. Iran has been accepted as a new member, and according to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, a total of about 20 countries wish to join BRICS and the SCO. Western powers are notably absent from both BRICS and the SCO, allowing the organizations to identify spheres of cooperation and create structures together that provide more autonomy from the Western-dominated system in pursuing shared interests. The failure of the West to isolate Russia is evidence of growing multipolarity. Russia is weathering coercive sanctions. Its oil is flowing internationally despite Western embargoes. The strengthening of Russia-China strategic ties, India s readiness to expand its ties with Russia despite Western pressures, and New Delhi s refusal to condemn Russia on the Ukraine issue are other examples. African countries reaching out to Russia, China brokering peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Turkey, despite being a NATO member, refusing to sanction Russia and, indeed, expanding ties with it, flow also from the emergence of multipolarity in the international system. The increasing use of national currencies for trade rather than the US dollar promises to be a major step in that direction as well. There is no doubt that the current play of tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, especially its effects on the interests of the Global South, will give a boost to multipolarity. It is important, however, that multipolarity should function in a multilaterally cooperative, equitable and peaceful framework and not one of competitive power plays based on alliance systems and military tensions.

"17 Apr, 2023",EU ambassador assaulted in Sudan,"Intense fighting in Khartoum has continued for days despite calls for a ceasefire from other nations The EU ambassador to Sudan was attacked on Monday amid continuing clashes between the nation s military and an influential paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the bloc s top diplomat, Josep Borrell,has claimed. The envoy was assaulted in his own residency, Borrell tweeted. He did not reveal any details regarding the incident, and did not say who was behind the attack. It is unclear if the EU ambassador was hurt in the assault. Borrell called the incident a gross violation of the Vienna Convention, adding that the security of diplomatic missions is the responsibility of the host nation under international law. Around two hours earlier, the EU s top diplomat said in another Twitterpostthat the bloc was working to persuade each side to consider [a] humanitarian pause and to encourage dialogue, adding that civilians""urgently need a ceasefire."" Earlier on Monday, Al Arabiya reported that a US Embassy vehicle was also attacked in Sudan. Sources with the embassy told the media outlet that RSF fighters opened fire on the armored vehicle. The car was deliberately targeted, the sources said, adding that around 100 bullets were fired at it. No one was injured in the incident, according to Al Arabiya. Clashes broke out on Saturday in Sudan amid the continuing power struggle between General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, led by his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Burhan has de facto led the nation s interim governments since the nation s longtime ruler, Omar Al-Bashir, was ousted in a coup in 2019. Khartoum has witnessed intense gunfire and bombardments over the past days, which have led to the deaths of at least 97 civilians, and left 365 others injured, according to the Sudanese medical authorities. Three UN World Food Programme employees were among those killed in the violence, forcing the agency s operations in Sudan to be temporarily halted. Calls for a ceasefire from the international community have intensified as the violence in the Sudanese capital rages on. On Monday, Washington and London joined forces to call for a return to negotiations in Khartoum. Moscow earlier expressed concern about the situation in Sudan, and encouraged the parties to the conflict to show political will and restraint and take prompt measures to cease fire. Leaders from East Africa reportedly held an emergency virtual session and called for an immediate halt to the hostilities. Egypt also offered itself as a mediator in the conflict.

The agency has temporarily halted operations in the country, she added. UN workers were slain on Saturday in the Kabkabiya District in the western part of the country, McCain said. She added that a WFP-operated aircraft was significantly damaged at Khartoum International Airport the same day. Any loss of life in humanitarian service is unacceptable and I demand immediate steps to guarantee the safety of those who remain, McCain said, adding that aid workers are neutral and should never be a target. While we review the evolving security situation, we are forced to temporarily halt all operations in Sudan, the WFP boss announced. On Saturday, clashes broke out in the capital Khartoum and other cities between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), an independent security branch with roots in pro-government militias. Each side has accused the other of starting hostilities. In 2019, Omar al-Bashir, Sudan s ruler of more than 25 years, was overthrown in a coup. The country has since been governed by the Transitional Sovereignty Council (TSC) that was briefly dissolved and then reinstated in the wake of another coup in 2021. The current conflict comes after a failed attempt to mediate growing tensions between army chief and TSC chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also the body s deputy chairman. Fighting was reported around the airport and the presidential palace, as well as around military bases. Dagalo claimed on Sky News Arabia on Saturday that his troops were in control of more than 90% of strategic sites in Khartoum. The Sudan Tribune, meanwhile, cited a SAF statement on Sunday as saying that the army has captured seven RSF bases across the country, including one in the capital. Egypt and South Sudan, sharing a border with Sudan, have called for a ceasefire. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi spoke over the phone with his South Sudanese counterpart, Salva Kiir, on Sunday. The leaders expressed readiness to mediate the end of the conflict, according to Sisi s spokesman, Ahmad Fahmy. At least 56 civilians were killed as of Sunday and 595 people, including soldiers, wounded, the Sudanese Doctors Union said, as cited by Al Jazeera.

"14 Apr, 2023",Cleopatra documentary sparks ethnicity row,"An online petition calling for the cancellation of an upcoming Netflix documentary about Cleopatra, Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, has received tens of thousands of signatures amid accusations that it is falsifying history by casting a black actress in the primary role. The trailer for Queen Cleopatra, which debuted online earlier this week ahead of its May 10 release date, was accompanied by a YouTube description that claimed that Cleopatra s heritage has been the subject of much academic debate, which has often been ignored by Hollywood. However, according to the originators of the online petition featured on the websiteChange.org, Hollywood has obscured the true debate and replaced it with Afrocentrism which has been described as centering black American cultural identities in Africa and African history. Afrocentrism is a pseudoscience, the petition reads. They are still attempting to falsify history. The description of the petition explains that Cleopatra was born in Alexandria, Egypt and was of Greek descent. She was NOT black, it adds, but cautions that people should not use this in any way, shape or form to be racist or prejudice[d] against black people. This is no fuel for nationalism either, it says. Only for the truth. Cleopatra, who was also of Macedonian lineage, ruled in Egypt for a period of 21 years between 51-30 BCE before her death at the age of 39. She spoke Koine Greek as her mother tongue but was the only Ptolemaic leader to learn and regularly use the Egyptian language. Speculation remains as to the exact cause of her death but it is generally agreed by historians to have occurred by her own hand. The British actress Adele James plays the lead role in the documentary, which was produced by Jada Pinkett-Smith, wife of the actor Will Smith.

"13 Apr, 2023",Pentagon leaks accuse China of arming Russia WaPo,"The outlet claims US spies had intercepted a Russian report about Beijing sending arms to Moscow The Washington Post claimed on Thursday that China had approved the supply of lethal aid to Russia, citing an alleged intercept of Russian communications mentioned in a classified Pentagon document. The document itself was allegedly found on a gaming forum and has not been previously mentioned in media reports. According to thePost, a February 23 summary from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) included a part about the US spies intercepting communications from the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). One such intercept reportedly said that China was willing to supply Russia with weapons and ammunition for use in Ukraine, but wanted to disguise them as civilian items. The outlet says it obtained the document from a group called Thug Shaker Central on the messaging application Discord. The Post had pointed the finger at the group as the source of classified files that have leaked to the general public over the past several weeks. The US government has not officially confirmed the authenticity of any of the documents, butdemandedthe media not cover their content and launched an internal hunt for the leaker. A member of the US Air National Guard,namedby the New York Times earlier on Thursday, has beenarrestedfor taking the documents from the classified setting. While the ODNI declined to comment on the Post story, two anonymous government officials said the US had not seen evidence that China has transferred weapons or provided lethal assistance to Russia. Washington has repeatedly accused Beijing of planning to supply Moscow with weapons or ammunition. China has responded by accusing the US of hypocrisy, as the West was endlessly shipping weapons to the battlefield in Ukraine, in the words of Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the US and its allies supplied $100 billion worth of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Kiev in 2022 alone. While vowing not to cover the documents in the name of national security, US media outlets have nonetheless amplified some of the claims allegedly contained in them without providing photos of the source. One such reportaccused Serbiaof sending weapons to Ukraine, which Belgrade denied as fake news. Moscow and Cairo also denied the allegation that Egypt wasselling ammunitionto Russia. Israel indignantlyrejected accusationsthat its security service Mossad was working against PM Benjamin Netanyahu, while South Koreadenouncedthe fabricated report of concerns about its weapons being used in Ukraine.

"13 Apr, 2023",Egypt accuses Ethiopia of buying time in Nile dam dispute,"Cairo has claimed Addis Ababa only agreed to negotiations in order to continue filling the river Egypt has accused Ethiopia of attempting to buy time with negotiations while continuing to build a disputed dam on the Nile River without agreement. The continuation of the negotiations for 10 years without results is evidence of Ethiopian intransigence, Egypt s deputy foreign minister for African affairs, Hamdi Loza, said in a statement on Wednesday. Loza also denied Ethiopia s claims that Cairo was politicizing the Nile water issue and the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). He said Egyptian concerns about the repercussions of the project on its water security are real and based on documented scientific evidence. The disagreement over the GERD dam has been ongoing for years, with Egypt and Sudan expressing concerns that its construction would negatively impact their water shares from the Nile. According to Loza, Addis Ababa s allegation is an attempt to evade legal responsibility and to disregard the principles of international law and good neighborliness. Egypt s minister of water resources and irrigation, Hani Sewilam, previously warned that unilateral actions concerning the GERD could pose an existential danger to the 150 million citizens of Egypt and Sudan. According to local media reports, the minister stressed at the opening plenary of the 2023 UN Water Conference on Wednesday that unilateral and non-cooperative practices in the operation of the dam can have a disastrous impact. Last month, the Ethiopian government accused Egypt of politicizing the Nile dam issue. The allegation came after the Arab League backed Egypt s Nile water rights in a resolution on March 9. According to reports, the council urged Ethiopia to be flexible in filling and operating the GERD. However, Addis Ababa expressed dissatisfaction with the resolution, saying it will continue to fill the dam and pursue an African solution to the crisis. The league is once again serving as the spokesperson of one state, disregarding basic principles of international law, the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued in a statement.

The claims are false and have no basis in truth, the senior officer said on Monday, according to Al Qahera News. The Washington Post in an article on Monday claimed that Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi had recently ordered subordinates to produce up to 40,000 rockets to be covertly shipped to Russia, citing leaked US intelligence documents. El-Sisi reportedly instructed his senior military officials in the top-secret document dated February 17 to keep the production and shipment of the rockets secret to avoid problems with the West. Responding earlier to the accusations, Egypt s Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Ahmed Abu Zeid told the media that the North African country s position from the beginning is based on non-involvement in this crisis and committing to maintain equal distance with both sides. She reaffirmed Egypt s support for the UN charter and international law in UN General Assembly resolutions. The government source cited by state-affiliated media Al Qahera News reiterated the same position. The unnamed official described the report as informational absurdity, saying that Egypt maintains a balanced policy with all international parties. Meanwhile, the White House has also said it had no indication that Cairo was providing Russia with deadly arms. A spokesperson for the US National Security Council, John Kirby, informed reporters that Egypt remains Washington s significant security partner. The United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years, he said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has also rejected the report describing it as another hoax. It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now.

The Washington Post cited a US intelligence document on Monday that claimed Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had ordered the production of up to 40,000 rockets so they could be discreetly shipped to Russia. El-Sisi was quoted as telling officials that the operation should be secret to avoid problems with the West. He also reportedly mentioned plans to supply Moscow with artillery rounds and gunpowder. According to the Post, the document was among alleged classified Pentagon files that were dumped online earlier this year and unearthed by news organizations last week. Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid told the Post that Cairo remains committed to non-involvement in the Ukraine conflict and to maintain equal distance with both sides. We continue to urge both parties to cease hostilities and reach a political solution through negotiations, Zeid said. Al Qahera News, meanwhile, cited an Egyptian official who claimed that the Post s story is nonsense that is not based on truth. Egypt has maintained close ties with Moscow since Soviet times and is one of the top buyers of Russian weapons. At the same time, the country has good relations with the US, as the two states share a history of security cooperation. The US has also provided military assistance to Egypt. The US and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict, aiming to cut its export revenues.

"10 Apr, 2023",Egyptian inflation skyrockets,"Food and beverage prices have more than doubled due to a currency crisis, official data has shown Annual urban inflation in Egypt jumped to 32.7% in March, its highest level since 2017, data from the national statistics agency CAPMAS showed on Monday. The increase has been driven by a sharp rise in food prices and the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. While consumer prices grew less than economists expected, inflation was still higher than the 31.9% recorded in February, led by a 62.9% rise in food and beverage costs. On a monthly basis, urban inflation growth slowed to 2.7% in March, down from 6.5% in February and 4.7% in January. Soaring prices are attributed to a plunge in the national currency following a series of devaluations over the last year. Surging seasonal demand during the month of Ramadan, high fuel prices and a shortage of raw materials, as well as a lack of foreign currency were also blamed for soaring consumer prices. A major importer of commodities, Egypt has devalued its currency three times since last March, further lifting the costs of most foreign goods. Skyrocketing inflation has also dealt a blow to Egyptian households as half of its 104 million people are now living near or below the poverty line. In an effort to contain prices, the Egyptian central bank raised interest rates in March by 200 basis points, although analysts have doubted that the measure will bring immediate relief. As pressure on the country s financial system mounts, authorities are seeking ways to boost foreign investment, including plans to sell stakes in a number of domestic companies.

According to the findings, the bloc of BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, contributes 31.5% of the world s GDP. Meanwhile, the G7, consisting of the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK, and considered the most advanced economic bloc of countries on the planet, add up to 30.7%. The gap between the two groups is expected to continue to grow, analysts say, as China and India are experiencing robust economic growth, and more countries are interested in joining BRICS. Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that more than a dozen nations have expressed an interest in joining BRICS, including Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bangladesh have acquired equity in the New Development Bank, BRICS funding organization. Last year, BRICS countries proposed creating their own currency in order to move away from the US dollar and the euro in mutual transactions.

"7 Apr, 2023",RT Arabic has huge influence in Middle East Analyst,"The channel's growing popularity facilitates Russia s disinformation war in the region, the outlet claims A Carnegie Endowment scholar has sounded the alarm over the growing prominence of RT s Arabic-language channel and website, warning that its success is all part of an alleged Russian disinformation war waged across the Middle East. In an opinion piece published in Politico on Friday, H.A. Hellyer, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and Cambridge University, bemoaned the lack of suppression of Russian media in the region. Hellyer praised the quick and decisive action taken by the UK, the US and the EU against RT and Sputnik, referred to the Western policy of banning and sanctioning Russian outlets over the invasion of Ukraine. The analyst omitted the fact that Western hostility toward the outlets had arguably long preceded the ongoing conflict. Russian media has thrived in the region due to a lack of pressure and bans from Middle Eastern countries, the author writes, claiming the outlets are attempting to wage a disinformation campaign there by saturating social media with Kremlin talking points and undermining opposition figures. RT Arabic is also one of the most popular news sites in the region, in some months outperforming even Al-Jazeera, while its YouTube channel has more dedicated subscribers than any other RT subsidiary, Hellyer wrote, adding that its popularity only intensified after the beginning of the ongoing hostilities between Moscow and Kiev. In total, RT Arabic s social media platforms have garnered a combined 804 million views a number that s risen exponentially since February 2022. Hellyer also complained about RT Arabic s prolific social media team, claiming that the outlet often posts content at two or three times the rate of Al-Jazeera or the BBC, and often multiple times. The goal appears to be to overload the audience with a flurry of information that s then retweeted and reposted ad nauseam and, thus, also serves to crowd out dissenting voices, the author wrote, warning that the social media presence is delivering pro-Kremlin propaganda directly to younger generations in the Arabic-speaking world. The Politico piece is the latest in a series of op-eds published by Western media outlets in recent weeks that have brought attention to the growing prominence of RT Arabic. Late in March, Foreign Policy published a similar piece warning that Russia s disinformation machine had a Middle East advantage. The article, penned by Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, also lamented that in the Middle East, Russian state-run media have retained full access to airwaves throughout the Ukraine crisis. Nathaniel Greenberg, an associate professor of Arabic at George Mason University, wrote a similar piece in Euronews last week, claiming Moscow has been seeking to make Egypt the linchpin in the new Cold War with the West. The alleged goal, according to the author, owes much of its success to extensive propaganda and the exploding popularity of RT Arabic. ",https://www.rt.com/news/574377-rt-arabic-middle-east/

Israeli media called the attack the most serious escalation since 2006, when Israel attempted to dislodge Hezbollah from southern Lebanon. That war is widely considered a Hezbollah victory. According to local media, Hamas and Hezbollah have placed their long-range rockets on high alert, and may strike at central Israel in response to the IDF bombing. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, whom Netanyahu fired last week but reinstated after public backlash, has instructed the IDF to prepare for all possible options of retaliation. All IDF personnel were reportedly recalled from leave and the units near the border with Lebanon placed on high alert on Thursday. Media outlets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have speculated that a strike on Gaza was certain, while another operation in Lebanon was highly likely. Earlier this week, Israeli riot police arrested hundreds of Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, disrupting services during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Some Palestinians had flocked to the mosque after reports that Israeli settlers were planning to ritually sacrifice a goat there. Previous clashes at al-Aqsa, in May 2021, triggered an11-day conflictbetween Israel and Hamas. It eventually ended in a ceasefire mediated by Egypt. Just last week, Netanyahu faced mass protests organized by the liberal opposition, which called for his resignation over the proposed overhaul of Israel s supreme court.

"6 Apr, 2023",China to launch rival undersea comms network Reuters,"Beijing and its partners reportedly hope to challenge the US dominance of the global communications infrastructure China s largest telecom firms are working on a massive undersea telecommunications cable network aimed at challenging the US dominance in operating global internet infrastructure, four people involved with the project told Reuters on Thursday. China Telecom, China Mobile Limited and China Unicom are in the planning stages of what is expected to be a $500-million undersea fiber optic project connecting Asia with the Middle East and Europe, the sources said. The sprawling network, known as EMA (Europe-Middle East-Asia), is reportedly intended to compete with another cable system currently under construction by US firm SubCom LLC called SeaMeWe-6 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-6). Chinese firm HMN Tech (formerly Huawei Marine Networks) was initially selected in 2020 to manufacture the cable for SeaMeWe-6 by a consortium that included the Chinese telecoms now working on EMA. However, a sustained US pressure campaign that included millions of dollars in training grants to foreign telecoms in return for switching their votes ultimately pushed the contract to HMN s US competitor last year, despite significantly higher costs. The three Chinese telecoms have reportedly signed agreements with telecoms in France, Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, with further deals in the works elsewhere in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The consortium hopes to bring EMA online by the end of 2025, the sources told Reuters. The advantages of such a project for China are obvious, one source told Reuters a faster connection between China, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world not under US control gives Beijing an insurance policy should they be cut off from US-controlled networks. Washington has been campaigning for years to convince allies to exclude Chinese companies from future infrastructure projects. However, Reuters sources said they fear the plan presages a growing division of global internet infrastructure into what a researcher for military-industrial think tank RAND Corporation described as a US-led internet and a Chinese-led internet ecosystem. The more the US and Chinese disengage from each other in the information technology domain, the more difficult it becomes to carry out global commerce and basic functions, RAND s Timothy Heath told Reuters, warning that forcing third countries to choose between the two sides would make technologies like GPS satellites and online banking much less reliable. Antonia Hmaidi, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies, agreed that splitting global internet traffic between two superpowers would significantly increase the likelihood of those superpowers manipulating and spying on data, with a general decline in quality and quantity of service until suddenly the whole fabric of the internet doesn t work as it was intended.

The official Palestinian Wafa news agency stated that dozens of worshippers had sustained injuries at the hands of Israeli police, who the media outlet claimed had used excessive force. The agency also alleged that Israeli security forces had prevented medics from entering the site. The violence broke out as Muslims celebrate the holiday month of Ramadan and Jews prepare to start the Passover festival on Wednesday evening. The Temple Mount is considered a holy site by both religions. Muslims had flocked to the Al-Aqsa Mosque after Jewish ultranationalists called for the ritual slaughter of a goat in the compound. The ancient practice is currently banned by Israeli authorities to preserve the fragile status quo, though this has not stopped some Jewish worshippers from insisting on performing the sacrifice inside the mosque. Overnight, at least nine missiles were fired from Gaza, most of which were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. In response, Israel unleashed airstrikes on what it described as Hamas training camps in Gaza. The Palestinian administration condemned the storming of the mosque by Israeli security forces as a crime that exceeds all red lines and will lead to a large explosion. Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have also strongly criticized Israel s use of force at the holy site, arguing that it undermines peace efforts in the region.

"2 Apr, 2023",Damascus and Cairo close to restoring ties WSJ,"Syrian President Bashar Assad could soon meet with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, sources say Syria and Egypt are in advanced talks to restore diplomatic relations that were severed after the outbreak of the conflict in Syria back in 2011, informed sources have told the Wall Street Journal. A summit is scheduled between Syrian President Bashar Assad and his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, shortly after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends in late April, the US outlet reported. On Saturday, Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad made his first official visit to Cairo in more than a decade, holding talks with Egypt s top diplomat Sameh Shoukry. According to the Syrian Foreign Ministry, the two sides discussed various aspects of bilateral cooperation and ways to strengthen brotherly relations during the meeting. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry in its statement reported that the ministers agreed to intensify channels of communication between the two countries at different levels during the coming phase. Shoukry reiterated Cario s support for a comprehensive political settlement to the Syrian crisis as soon as possible, the statement read. According to WSJ s sources, the parties were also expected to discuss Syria s possible return to the Arab League during the talks in Cairo. Damascus participation in the group of 22 nations was suspended 12 years ago when members accused Syria of a violent crackdown on opposition. Assad s government, which insists that it has been fighting international terrorism all those years, has by now been able to regain almost full control of Syrian territory with the assistance of its allies Russia and Iran. Diplomatic relations between Cairo and Damascus were cut in 2013 under the previous Islamist Egyptian government of Mohamed Morsi, which backed the Syrian opposition. When announcing the closure of the embassy in Syria, Morsi also decried the involvement of Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in the conflict on the side of Damascus and urged that a no-fly zone be established above the country. The mending of relations between Damascus and the rest of the Arab World has been spearheaded by the United Arab Emirates, which reopened its Syrian embassy in 2018 and has been visited by Assad twice over the past two years. Last week, Syria and Saudi Arabia also agreed to re-establish their diplomatic missions. ",https://www.rt.com/news/574016-syria-egypt-ties-assad/
"1 Apr, 2023","From WWI to the Ukraine conflict, war propaganda evolves, but never changes","Lionizing your own side and demonizing the enemy has been as important as battlefield victories ByMatthieu Buge, who worked on Russia for the magazine l Histoire, the Russian film magazine S√©ance, and as a columnist for Le Courrier de Russie. He is the author of the book Le Cauchemar russe ('The Russian Nightmare'). Since the beginning of Russia s military operation in Ukraine, Western spin-doctors have been busy. But despite the rapid technological progress that changed the world over the last decades, the principles of war propaganda remain the same. Thomas Hobbes, the 17th century English philosopher, considered war as the natural state of mankind. His 20th century counterpart, Carl Schmitt, explained that war is the utmost political action. Consequently, just as with any policy, war has to be the subject of intense propaganda from all sides of a conflict. War propaganda, however, is something quite recent in human history. War always had to be justified in some way, but the appearance of photography, modern communications technology and mass media meant it has become an essential part of warfare. The first modern coverage by a journalist of an armed conflict is usually considered to be William Howard Russell s work during the Crimean war of 1852-1855. However, politicians and armies started to really take the impact of journalism on populations into consideration only with the Boer war, fought between the British Empire and Dutch-speaking republics of southern Africa in 1899-1902. The British government faced a lack of support at home and a propaganda strategy from the Boers, who internationally directed their newspapers and agents in the hope of gaining foreign support. A war-time propaganda strategy had to be, and was, elaborated. As Kenneth O. Morgan, from Queen s college, Oxford, puts it: The consequences of the Boer War on the media and its representation of war were inevitably massive [ ] The media coverage did have an important effect in helping to stimulate anti-war sentiment in the later stages of the war."" Democracies such as France and the UK even began to work closely together during the First World War. During the 1920s and 30s, they elaborated various strategies, including radio programs and air-dropped propaganda leaflets, in order to have the enemy population revolt against its leaders or at least develop anti-war sentiments. However, during a conflict, internal stability and unity are essential, and as such war propaganda has to focus mainly on domestic publics. In a 1944 text entitled What is propaganda? (availableon the site of the American Historical Association), Professor Ralph D. Casey drew a quite surprising conclusion: These simple truths determine the underlying or governing principles of democratic propaganda. The Nazis blindfold their people against the truth. In exact opposition to the rules of Hitler, the democratic countries must present the truth in their propaganda. A free people will soon find out the truth in spite of official suppressions and distortions. And when propaganda has been revealed to be deceitful and distorted, it no longer is effective. Moreover, democratic propaganda must observe the right of the people to know the facts, however unpleasant they may be. The strategy of truth is not only in accord with the basic principles of democracy, but is also a hardheaded and realistic policy for effective dealing with allies, neutrals, and even enemies. Conversely, history shows that the war propaganda strategies that have been developed, both before and since Casey s statement, fully contradict this recommendation. When war is declared, truth is the first casualty while the quote may have been wrongly attributed to him, British politician Arthur Ponsonby had exhaustively worked on the matter. His book Falsehood in Wartime (1928) describes the lies that were propagated by Western democracies against the Kaiser s Germany. In 2001, Belgian historian Anne Morelli systemized Ponsonby s thoughts and remarks in her work The Basic Principles of War Propaganda . Most of her arguments can fit the war propaganda of any type of regime, but Western democracies resort to them with exceptional effectiveness. Since the Cold War, the strategic approach has been dominated by the US, which has the biggest number of think tanks, bolstered by European strategic foundations which are largely Atlanticist. Democracies do not want war, their adversary is the only one responsible. If the Western rhetoric is to be believed, liberal democracies can only be the targets and victims of other types of political regimes, which want to attack their freedom, destroy their values or undermine their model. According to the official version of historical events, Germany solely desired WWI, Germany and Japan provoked WWII, and the Soviet Union s attitude was solely responsible for the Cold War. Currently, the Western mass media frame Russia as the only country responsible for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The simplicity of this political discourse is such that most Western populations are convinced that their country can t desire a war because it is a democracy. With this tool in hand, arms races and wars can be justified as the only protection and the only way to guarantee peace. George Orwell warned about this in 1984 war is peace. Ponsonby, back in his day, already insisted on the fact that the German Emperor was systematically depicted as a criminal during WWI. This has been used and reused, as the personification of the enemy has a much more efficient psychological impact on the public than demonizing a whole population. The technique is so obvious that the French have invented the expression hitl√©risation de l adversaire (hitlerization of the enemy). Since 1914, very few conflicts have avoided this pattern. During the UK-Argentina Falklands War of 1982, the rhetoric had to be used against a collective military junta, and during the Vietnam and Afghan wars, it had to be more focused on ideological matters. However, demonizing the head of state of the opponent is easy, costs nothing, and always proves efficient. To quote Francis Bacon: Hurl your calumnies boldly; something is sure to stick. Consequently, the ones fighting the incarnation of evil are not pursuing personal interests and can only be serving a good cause. George Bush s crusade against the axis of evil or the West s so-called noble task to immediately free Afghan women come to mind, but the just war theory is actually a constant in history that can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Liberal democracies, obviously, can t avoid this step, as a morally unjustified war would have a very negative impact on the voting public. In the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, both sides resort to this. Russia focuses on the Ukrainian neo-Nazi battalions and its wish to protect Russian-speaking populations, while the West focuses on the personality of Vladimir Putin and its task to protect democratic values in Ukraine and Europe. The just war theory implies that the evil enemy commits atrocities, while the noble side can only commit mistakes. This manipulation is neither new nor rare. The most famous journalist in history, Joseph Pulitzer, himself fabricated pieces of atrocity propaganda during the Spanish-American war. Ponsonby points to all the tales that were spread about the supposed crimes committed by the Germans on babies in Belgium during WWI. Morelli reports the same kind of rumors and stories were spread during the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. With television, this technique became even more powerful with the famous 1990Nayirah testimony, according to which the Iraqis were killing babies in Kuwait. The claims are now recognized as a complete fabrication and a benchmark moment in the history of atrocity propaganda. The use of illegal weapons is also frequently denounced as a war crime in almost every conflict. However, Colin Powell s 2003 address at the UN to justify Washington s war in Iraq has proved that these types of accusations can be loosely factual or completely fabricated. Since the beginning of Russia s special military operation in Donbass, the Western mass media have frequently reported presumed Russian war crimes, while ignoring reports of a few Western journalists detailing allegations against Ukrainian forces. This is one of the most important principles of war propaganda and we can find its roots in the Boer war. Kenneth O. Morgan explains: Emily Hobhouse s graphic description of the mass deaths in the concentration camps in 1901 was fully reported in the Manchester Guardian, the Speaker, and other Liberal journals and had a powerful impact on opinion. As soon as the war was over, the British media were pivotal in voicing disgust with the concentration camps and the colossal loss of life that resulted: one-quarter of the entire population of Boer women and children in the two Boer republics lost their lives in the space of around fifteen months. It had become clear that humanitarian considerations had to be at the center of any war propaganda effort. Legitimization of war being essential, it is highly desirable to have intellectuals and artists backing the effort, and this is maybe where the West is at his best. As Western democracies argue that they wage only just wars , it is the role of intellectuals and artists, who have a deep influence on the public s perception of the evolution of the world, to justify conflicts from an almost philosophical point of view. They coin highly effective formulas to denounce the enemy or celebrate the heroism of their own side. The famous engagement of prominent figures such as Ernest Hemingway, Andr√© Malraux, or George Orwell in the Spanish civil war had shown that intellectuals were easily drawn into a war when they saw a just cause in it. This is certainly why WWI divided so many intellectuals and artists: it didn t have an ideological cause. However, something changed in the last decades. As the French expert in geostrategy Pierre Conesa explained, intellectuals do not have any military experience anymore and are not ready to give up their keyboards for a rifle. However, their role is such that Conesa even discusses a military-intellectual complex that works in parallel to its military-industrial sibling. In Europe, the main leader of these intellectuals is the notorious French philosopher Bernard-Henri L√©vy, who has been pushing for war almost everywhere, from Yugoslavia to Libya to Ukraine, for democracy s sake. Noam Chomsky once remarked: I think one of the healthy things about the United States is precisely this: there s very little respect for intellectuals as such. And there shouldn t be. What s there to respect? I mean, in France if you re part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there s a front page story in Le Monde. That s one of the reasons why French intellectual culture is so farcical it s like Hollywood Consequently, this aspect of just war propaganda is managed by intellectuals in Europe and by artists in Hollywood. For the American population, following Chomsky s logic, it is way more significant to see actor Sean Penn paying a visit to former actor Vladimir Zelensky during the conflict. Sean Penn says the US has lost its soul if it allows Ukraine to fight Russia alone, as the Independent titled its article on the visit. Hence, the legitimate war develops into an almost sacred cause. Kenneth O. Morgan further wrote: The involvement of the media in the Boer War went on long after the war ended in May 1902. After the war, the British media attempted to project the chivalrous, almost light-hearted nature of the war. The enemy s casualties must be presented as considerably more serious than ours and the morale of our troops considerably better than the motivation of its soldiers. The enthusiasm for the sacred cause must prevail. The fact that British and French intelligence services maintained a common distrust during WWI or that not all EU member states are in favor of arming Kiev has to be concealed in some way or considered as a minor difficulty. The unity of the ones fighting evil must appear unbreakable. Consequently, those who doubt or pronounce their anti-war sentiments are frequently considered to be traitors. Opponents to the Kosovo wars were considered Milosevic s accomplices; people who do not fully back Ukraine are considered Putin s allies. You are either with us or against us. War propaganda principles never change. Before, during and after the conflict, it has to mobilize populations and compose an epic, almost mythical narrative. Its fundamental methodology has not changed in 150 years. Propaganda being political, truth is rarely part of the program.",https://www.rt.com/news/573441-war-propaganda-wwi-ukraine/

"29 Mar, 2023",Pentagon prints playing cards to train Ukrainians NYT,"The pack features NATO-made weapons systems, including those shipped to Kiev to fight Russia, the newspaper said The US Army is to print a deck of playing cards featuring NATO weapons systems and will send them to states outside of the US-led bloc, including Ukraine, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. The cards will supposedly help Ukrainian troops tell friends from foes. The tool was developed by the US Army s Training and Doctrine Command and will enable soldiers to quickly identify enemy equipment and distinguish the equipment from friendly forces, according to its spokesman, Maj. Andrew Harshbarger. It features information about NATO equipment that has proliferated to non-NATO countries. According to draft examples posted by the Times, each card has a photo of a weapons system and lists its country of origin, manufacturer, the munitions used and operators. For example, the US-made M-270 MLRS rocket artillery launcher is said to have been sold to Bahrain, Egypt, Finland, Israel, the UAE and Ukraine. Kiev received some of the systems from the UK last year. The newspaper said most but not all of the face cards feature American systems. Christopher Skaluba, a former senior Pentagon official who works in the pro-NATO Atlantic Council, told the Times it was the first Pentagon deck that he knew of that included only NATO arms. The US military has been printing playing cards doubling as training aids since World War II, but usually they are meant to teach soldiers how to tell friendly forces from enemies in the field. Russia and Ukraine have some common Soviet-designed weapons in their arsenals, but Russian troops do not use NATO hardware. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Pentagon also produced a deck with photos of top government officials, including Saddam Hussein, depicted as the ace of spades. The US and its allies have showered Ukraine with military assistance, claiming it would help the country defeat Russia. Moscow considers the conflict to be part of a Western proxy war instigated by Washington. Western arms producers have enjoyed a windfall as NATO members scrambled to replace stockpiles depleted by donating aid to Ukraine. ",https://www.rt.com/news/573797-pentagon-cards-nato-hardware/
"27 Mar, 2023",First man in space: How a Russian pilot fulfilled mankind s dream to leave the planet,"Exactly 62 years ago, Yuri Gagarin made his flight into the unknown Wednesday marks the International Day of Human Space Flight ‚Äî known in Russia as 'Cosmonautics Day ‚Äî dedicated to the first manned mission. Exactly 62 years ago, on April 12, 1961, a citizen of the Soviet Union, Senior Lieutenant Yuri Gagarin, made his orbital journey around the Earth. His voyage on the Vostok spacecraft inspired the world and wrote his hame into the history books. This feature was first published on March 27, the 55th anniversary of his tragically early death. On the chilly morning of March 27, 1968, the low gray sky of the Kirzhach area of Russia's Vladimir Region was pierced by the roar of an engine. A two-seat jet fighter plummeted through the rainy clouds, cutting off the tops of trees and disintegrating in flight before hitting the ground at great speed. An explosion followed. A piece of a flight jacket was left hanging on a birch tree. In the pocket was an unused breakfast ticket: With the name ""Gagarin Yu. A."" Arguably, the most famous person on the planet had died an internationally recognized hero, the idol of Soviet youth, the first person in space. The results of an interdepartmental investigation of the crash were collected in 29 volumes, and its final verdict was classified by the authorities. How did Yuri Gagarin die? In his biography, the legendary cosmonaut has been portrayed as the boy next door the third child of a carpenter and a dairymaid from a small central Russian town. During the Second World War, he and his family lived under Nazi occupation. His parents did not collaborate with Adolf Hitler's men, nor did they engage in partisan activities they merely survived. After the war, Yuri moved to Moscow after finishing sixth grade and entered a vocational school. He began learning the mold maker s trade and joined the Komsomol youth organization. Having mastered a basic profession, Gagarin entered the industrial college of Saratov, where he became known for his athletic abilities and character. Soon, the future pilot took an interest in aviation, an area which enjoyed great popularity in the USSR, as the Kremlin leader Joseph Stalin placed great emphasis on its development. Gagarin joined the aeroclub of the DOSAAF Soviet defense and sports organization. This undertaking presented no problem for the excellent student and Komsomol member, who made his first independent flight at the age of 21 on a Yak-18 training aircraft. In total, Yuri completed 196 flights in the aero club and flew 42 hours and 23 minutes. That same year, Gagarin was drafted into the army, where he was assigned to an aviation school and even appointed assistant platoon commander. He was an excellent student in almost all piloting disciplines only landing was a problem. This was typical for short pilots due to his stature, the viewing angle was impaired. As a result, Gagarin tended to slam the plane on the runway. To solve this issue, he put a thick cushion on his seat so he could see the front of the aircraft better. He graduated with an excellent mark in the fall of 1957 and was sent to serve in the Northern Fleet, where he flew a MiG-15 fighter. As an excellent student of combat with sound physical and political training, he was soon chosen for the first cosmonaut squad of 20 people, created in April 1960. Psychologists noted his lively, proactive character: He loves events with lots of action, where heroism, the will to win, and the spirit of competition prevails. In sports, he takes the role of initiator the leader and captain of the team. As a rule, his will to win, endurance, determination, and understanding of his team play a role here. His favorite word is work . He makes sensible suggestions at meetings. He is always self-assured and confident in his abilities. But this didn't matter much to the Soviet space program, which was in a race with the US, and needed to speed up its development. The R-7 launch vehicle created by designer Sergey Korolev had some well-known flaws. From the point of view of the designers, the main requirements were that they were fighter aviators accustomed to high G-forces who were no more than 170cm tall, weighed no more than 70 kilograms (to fit into the Vostok capsule), were aged 25-30, physically fit, disciplined, and psychologically stable. There was not much confidence in the last point, so the designers came up with a kind of fuse . It was thought that the first person in space might panic and try to manually take control of the spacecraft. In anticipation of this, he was given an envelope with a complex mathematical problem only by coming to his senses and solving it could the cosmonaut take the reins. In general, the design specialists took a utilitarian approach to selecting cosmonauts. The final decision on would fly to space was made by the head of the Soviet state, Nikita Khrushchev, who had succeeded Stalin. Perhaps it was Gagarin s ordinariness, his lack of awards and serious track record, that played a decisive role. If Lenin posited that any cook can run the country, then Khrushchev held that any mold caster can fly into space. It was Khrushchev who made Gagarin a superstar. However, before becoming the most famous person in the world, Yuri had to practically disappear. In the atmosphere of the Cold War, the USSR could not afford even a chance of public failure, so the launch of the rocket on April 12, 1961 was carried out in the strictest secrecy. Yuri s wife and daughters did not even know about the flight. The farewell letter written to them before the launch would be published many years later, after Gagarin s actual death. However, as soon as it became clear that the flight was successful and the cosmonaut had returned alive and well, an almost endless series of celebrations and receptions began. At the landing site, Gagarin was awarded the somewhat ironic For the Development of Virgin Lands medal. At the airfield in the city of Engels, he was handed a congratulatory telegram from the Soviet government, and the Air Force command and journalists arrived there a couple of days later. The voice of TASS, Yuri Levitan, announced to the whole world that the first manned space flight had been piloted by Soviet citizen Gagarin. The cosmonaut personally reported on the successful flight to the highest government officials via a secure line. After that, the he was transported to a government dacha in Kuibyshev on the Volga, and a couple of hours later, designers and program managers headed by Korolev arrived and sat down to celebrate at nine in the evening. This was only the first party for the Soviet officer, who had been a complete unknown in the morning, writing a farewell letter to his wife. It was far from the last. A day later, the cosmonaut was met in Moscow. Khrushchev personally secured Gagarin s promotion from senior lieutenant to major from the reluctant defense minister, Rodion Malinovsky. On approach to Moscow, his plane was met by a solemn escort of seven MiG-17 fighters. The flying motorcade passed over the center of the capital and Red Square, and landed at Vnukovo. A red carpet was stretched from the ramp to the podium, along which cheering people, journalists, and cameramen stood. Gagarin walked down the path to Khrushchev with his shoelace untied. To the cheers of the welcoming crowds, Khrushchev and Gagarin rode in an open limousine to Red Square, where Gagarin was awarded the titles Hero of the USSR and Cosmonaut of the USSR at a solemn ceremony in the presence of the country s highest officials. The rally lasted three hours, and another private gathering in the inner halls of the Kremlin went on for another three. A press conference for the foreign press was scheduled for the next day. Gagarin was given practically no time to recover. He became Khrushchev s main PR tool in the international arena. Even during the five-day post-flight medical examination, two Pravda newspaper correspondents were assigned to the cosmonaut to write an autobiography, The Road to Space . On April 28, just two weeks after his legendary flight, he went to Czechoslovakia, from which his world tour began. In May, he was in Bulgaria; in June, Finland; and in July, the UK. It is noteworthy that Gagarin, a foundry worker by profession, was invited to Britain by the general secretary of the foundry workers union. There, he had lunch with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, laid a wreath at Karl Marx s grave, and had breakfast with the Queen. She even agreed to a joint photo in violation of protocol. Gagarin was no longer an earthly man he was capable of anything. He returned to Moscow on July 15, but was already off to Poland on the 20th. After celebrating the 17th anniversary of the liberation of the country from the Nazi invaders and participating in an all-Polish youth rally in Zielona Gora, he returned to Moscow on the evening of the 22nd. At midnight the next day, he was already on his way across the Atlantic, visiting Iceland, Canada, and of course, Cuba, where there was a big celebration and a reception with Fidel Castro. Then, he went on to Curacao, Brazil, and returned by the same route. In August, he was feted in Hungary; in November, in India and Sri Lanka; and in December, in Afghanistan. This went on for quite a long time: Egypt, Libya, Ghana, Liberia, Greece, Cyprus, Austria, Japan; again Finland, Denmark, and France; again Cuba, Mexico, and East Germany; and in October 1963, he visited the US at the invitation of the UN secretary general. Then Sweden, Norway, and again, France. Obviously, there were solemn meetings, receptions, rallies, speeches, and breakfasts with monarchs everywhere. In Norway, the cosmonaut went to the sea to fish and visited the Grieg Museum at the request of Norwegian sailors. Gagarin lived according to this crazy regime for almost three years. It was said that he began to drink a bit, his former work routine completely forgotten. Finally, Gagarin s name gradually began to disappear from the front pages of the world media. And for Khrushchev, Gagarin s biggest international promoter, an uneasy situation began, which ended with his resignation. The 30-year-old colonel, who was at the peak of his fame, had to integrate back into normal life. In between trips, he attended classes at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy. But his main task was to prepare for the next space flight and return to permanent service in fighter aviation. It was determined that, over the years of his tours, he had lost the qualifications to be a fighter pilot and needed to be retrained. As part of this process, a routine flight took place on March 27, 1968. Yuri was familiar with the plane a training modification of a MiG-15 with a paired cockpit for an instructor and additional fuel tanks. The instructor was Vladimir Seregin, an experienced test pilot of the 1st class who had received the Hero s Star for assault sorties during the Great Patriotic War. It was assumed that, in the event of an emergency, control of the aircraft would pass to him. One peculiarity about the training MiG-15 was that the instructor himself had to eject before the pilot could. The weather was unpleasant, but it was acceptable for a simple flight task low clouds with a couple of kilometers of clearance above, and then thick clouds again. Gagarin and Seregin s plane took off at the Chkalovsky airfield at 10:18 in the morning. The task should have taken about 20 minutes, but at 10:30, Gagarin reported its successful completion and requested permission to turn around and return to base. The plane was not heard from again. The search for the wreckage took quite a long time. The crash site was finally found at 2:50pm about 65 kilometers from the airfield, 18 kilometers from the city of Kirzhach in Vladimir Region. The State Commission started working the next day. The shocking death of the first man in space, the large-scale investigation, and the secrecy of its results sparked numerous rumors about the causes of the disaster. Some believed that the all-powerful KGB had decided to remove the popular figure. Others speculated about a UFO encounter. Another story was that Gagarin and Seregin had died a few days earlier during the completion of the L-1 lunar flyby program. And, of course, there was the inevitable conjecture that the pilot and the instructor had taken a glass of vodka before departure. More reasonable theories envision the dangerous approach of another aircraft performing training tasks in the same area, which caused the plane to fall into a tailspin in its wake. The idea that the cabin had depressurized due to a collision with a weather balloon was also put forth. The most logical theory still seems to be that the crash was due to a piloting error and bad weather data. Having had many calm, routine flights, Gagarin completed the task in a band of acceptable cloud cover twice as fast as he should have, reported to the ground that he was returning, and dove down through a solid cloud bank. According to his and Seregin s calculations, they should have emerged from the clouds and seen the horizon at an altitude of about 900 meters, but the clouds had fallen lower. When the pilots finally saw the ground, there was no time to pull out of the dive at such speed with so much momentum, although both officers fought until the last moment to level the plane. The self-confidence of an impatient ace, who had grown accustomed to celebrations, balls, and his own exceptionalness, compounded by rapidly changing weather conditions, most likely caused the tragic accident. The banality of this version also explains its secrecy. The Soviets could not put the first man in space and then have been seen to so stupidly fail to protect him. It was better to let rumors circulate among the people than allow the whole world to find out about the simple mistakes made in the preparation and execution of routine training flights. Gagarin and Seregin were cremated the day after their deaths. Their ashes were placed in the necropolis of the Kremlin Wall.

"26 Mar, 2023",Agatha Christie novels chopped by sensitivity readers media,"Agatha Christie s detective novels have been censored by sensitivity readers ahead of their reissue, The Telegraph reported on Saturday. Christie is the latest author after Roald Dahl and Ian Fleming to have their works posthumously cleaned up for a modern audience. The changes were made to new editions of Christie s Poirot and Miss Marple detective novels, which are set to be released or have been released since 2020. Citing industry insiders, The Telegraph claimed that publisher HarperCollins hired a team of sensitivity readers to pore over Christie s 1927-1976 catalog in search of outdated terms. Most of the changes reportedly concern descriptions of non-British characters and insults based on characters appearance. The term Oriental has been removed from the 1937 Poirot novel Death on the Nile . So too has the word""Nubian,""used to describe an indigenous group native to southern Egypt. The word native too has been removed from several Christie novels, replaced with local. In the 1964 Miss Marple novel A Caribbean Mystery , an entire passage describing a black woman hiding in bushes at night has been removed, as has a description of a female character as having a torso of black marble. The word n***er has been completely cut from Christie's books, while Poirot s observation in The Mysterious Affair at Styles that another character is a Jew, of course has likewise been dropped. The character of Mrs. Allerton in Death on the Nile no longer says of a group of children that their eyes are simply disgusting, and so are their noses, and Miss Marple herself no longer marvels at the lovely white teeth of a black hotel worker in A Caribbean Mystery . HarperCollins madesimilar changesto Ian Fleming s James Bond novels, which are set for re-release this year. However, not all of Fleming s potentially offensive phrasing was cut from the Bond series, and the reissued books reportedly still include some outdated descriptions of women and gay people. HarperCollins is not the only publisher giving classic books a politically-correct makeover. Penguin Random House caused outrage when it announced last month that hundreds of changes including the removal of terms such as fat and ugly had been made to Roald Dahl s beloved children s stories. Amid a public backlash, the publisherdecidedto reissue the books in both edited and unedited versions. ",https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/573631-agatha-christie-censored-racism/
"25 Mar, 2023",Statue of ancient Egyptian pharaoh unearthed,"Stone fragments depicting Ramses II were discovered at a Sun temple near Cairo, the Ministry of Tourism has said Archaeologists have unearthed several pieces of statues of ancient Egyptian royalty at a temple near Cairo, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced on Monday. Among them are parts of a statue of the Pharaoh Ramses II, Egypt s most powerful and celebrated ruler, who reigned more than 3,000 years ago. The discoveries also include statues of Ramses IX, Horemheb, and Psamtik II, who reigned from 1126-1108 BC, 1323-1295 BC, and 595-589 BC, respectively. The depictions were unearthed during an excavation by Egypt s Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Leipzig Museum in Germany at an archaeological site near the Museum for the Cultural Heritage of Heliopolis, in Egypt s Matareya region. The Egyptian team found several pieces of quartzite sarcophagi dating back to Horemheb s reign, around 3,300 years ago. Another depicting King Psamtik II is made of greywacke stone. They also found fragments of a limestone floor and parts of another royal statue, the identity of which is unknown, but whose features suggest it could be over 4,000 years old, the ministry noted in a post on Facebook. The German team uncovered multiple parts of Ramses II statues with the body of a sphinx made of quartz, as well as a fragment from Ramses IX s reign. They also discovered an inscribed pink granite stone, which is most likely the upper part of an obelisk from Ramses II s era. This contributes to a better understanding of the history of this area, Mostafa Waziri, the secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said, as quoted in the statement. The ministry also confirmed that traces of mud-brick walls and flooring dating back to the second half of the first millennium BC were discovered north of the museum, indicating stability in this part of the temple during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. During Greco-Roman times, the temple was largely destroyed, and many of its obelisks were relocated to Alexandria or Europe. As Cairo developed, stones and statues from the site were looted and used as building materials, the Daily Mail reported. Waziri added that work in the area is ongoing, and more results will be published in the coming months. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/573584-egypt-statue-pharaoh-unearthed/
"25 Mar, 2023",Why US efforts to reduce Israel-Palestine tensions keep failing,"The latest Washington-sponsored summit aims to bring stability to the Middle East, but is based on outdated policies Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . US-sponsored dialogue between the Palestinian Authority and Israel is proving ineffective due to recent developments, but Washington refuses to adapt its policy approach. Last Sunday, Palestinian Authority (PA) officials met with their Israeli counterparts in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh seeking to reduce tensions between both sides in the next 4-6 months. Egyptian, Jordanian, and US officials also took part in the discussions, which served as a continuation of a similar US-sponsored security summit, held in Aqaba, Jordan, in February. The US State Department released aJoint Communiqueon March 19, confirming that all sides in Sharm el-Sheikh had agreed on a number of relatively ambiguous steps to reach a state of calm in the Holy Land. The summit, despite its hopefully worded intentions, has so far failed to have any real impact on the ground in terms of bringing about calm between Palestinians and Israelis. Shortly after the meeting, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on Israeli settlers in the West Bank town of Hawara. This again triggered violent attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in surrounding villages. A similar incident took place during February s Aqaba summit. Then the settlers retaliatory attacks weredubbed a pogrom , and while the latest ones weren t quite as severe, they continued to inspire further confrontation. The Biden administration has sent a number of delegations to the region in recent months, the most high profile visits coming from US secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin. Following both visits and despite declarations through the media that Israel had committed to respecting Washington s calls to halt illegal settlement expansion and violent military raids inside the West Bank, the leadership in Tel Aviv* demonstrated the very opposite. On the Palestinian Authority side, the US has presented what is now known asthe Fenzel Plan, which seeks to create an American-trained PA force that will tackle newly-formed Palestinian armed groups inside the West Bank. The problem with such a plan is that it is nearly impossible to execute, due to widespread public opposition to it inside the occupied territories and overwhelming public support for the armed groups. It could even result in an insurrection against the PA itself. Washington s position on the conflict continues to pay lip service to a two-state solution, but with the caveat that the Biden administration refuses to condition its support for Israel and punish Tel Aviv for crossing its own red-lines. In the past, due to the relative stability of the Israeli political scene and pragmatism of successive Israeli government s, Tel Aviv was capable of violating US red-lines on issues such as settlement expansion and conflict escalation, because it was always able to take concise and calculated steps that kept any violent uptick under its control. Today s reality is something very different. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s new government is maintaining its power through acceding to the demands of the Religious Zionism party, which holds the second largest number of seats in the ruling coalition. Netanyahu is facing mass opposition and civil disobedience from hundreds of thousands of Israelis who oppose his government's proposed judicial reforms. These reforms, if enacted, will essentially eliminate the Israeli supreme court's supervisory role over the government, sparking dissent even fromwithin Israel s reserve armyand airforce. Meanwhile, the same far-right coalition partners of Netanyahu s Likud party-led government that are pushing for the judicial reforms are also pushing their anti-Palestinian agenda. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who also has special oversight over the West Bank, has an Israeli settler background and his politics are not calculated like his Likud party allies. Recently, Smotrich was forced to apologize after calling on the government to erase an entire Palestinian town, immediately after extremist settlers had burned down hundreds of homes and vehicles there. Following the Sharm el-Sheikh security summit, which aimed to bring Jordan closer to Israel in order to effect calm, Smotrichdelivered a speech in Pariswhere he stated""there were no such thing as Palestinian people"", while standing next to a map, which included parts of Jordan, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, as constituting Israel. The Jordanian parliament responded byvoting to recommend the expulsion of Israel s ambassador. Similarly, Israel s security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who is also a West Bank settler, provoked Jordan s ire at the United Nations Security Council after a provocative incursion into the al-Aqsa Mosque in January. The Israeli government has already tabled two major pieces of anti-Palestinian legislation which have so far passed the preliminary stage and which seek to introduce both the death penalty and the stripping of citizenship from Palestinians inside Israel, if they commit an attack on Israelis. Itamar Ben Gvir has also introduced new hardline tactics to punish Palestinian political prisoners, sparking civil disobedience and the declaration of a widespread hunger strike. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is, in essence, being held hostage by the extremists in his coalition. Not only does the survival of his government depend upon the support of the Religious Zionism party, they could also keep him safe from criminal prosecution in his ongoing corruption trial if they pass legislation granting immunity to the sitting PM. The issue of the newly proposed judicial reforms provides important context. Israeli President Isaac Herzog has warned the reforms could spark civil war if passed. If the PM does not back down over those implications, there is almost no hope that he will prevent the escalatory measures that Religious Zionism ministers are calling for against Palestinians, through a non-binding dialogue with the US, PA, Jordan, and Egypt. The current US government's unconditional support for Israel not only gives the Netanyahu government a green light to escalate tensions when it deems it necessary, but it also isolates regional players such as Jordan and Egypt. Close US relations with Amman and Cairo play an integral part in maintaining Washington s influence in the Middle East, however, its outdated Israel policy may end up challenging these alliances too. Throwing money at the PA to cooperate further with Israel and to form a special force to fight Palestinian armed groups will not prevent the continuation of armed struggle in the West Bank either. The only way forward is playing a balanced hand, which US President Joe Biden is clearly refusing to do. *Russia recognizes West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,as shownon the Russian Foreign Ministry s Consular Department website ",https://www.rt.com/news/573540-us-israel-palestine-tensions/
"21 Mar, 2023",Russia boosting trade with Egypt official,"Bilateral cooperation boomed last year despite Western sanctions on Moscow Russia and Egypt are ramping up economic cooperation after a surge in trade turnover last year, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov, who serves as minister of industry and trade, said on Monday. Trade turnover jumped to over $6 billion in 2022, marking a 30% increase on the previous year, Manturov said at a meeting of the Russian-Egyptian Commission on Trade during a visit to Cairo. Economic cooperation between Russia and Egypt has grown despite Ukraine-related Western sanctions on Moscow. Manturov noted that Russia is looking for continued gradual growth and expects imports of various products from Egypt to expand, particularly agricultural goods. Officials also discussed Russian investment in the North African country and the promotion of joint projects, including Egypt s first nuclear power plant at El Dabaa, which is currently under construction. The establishment of a Russian industrial zone in the Suez Canal area was also on the agenda. Manturov noted that Egypt could sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) in the near future, adding that the move will contribute to further diversification in trade between the countries. The Russian deputy PM also highlighted the prospects for establishing payments in local currencies in bilateral trade. Our finance ministries and central banks are working hard to find the best ways to secure payments for our economic operators, primarily using the currencies of the two countries, as well as friendly countries, Manturov said. Moscow is steadily pursuing a policy of de-dollarization in foreign trade. In recent years, Russia and several of its trade partners, including India and China, have ramped up the use of domestic currencies in mutual settlements in an effort to move away from the dollar and euro.

"19 Mar, 2023",Egypt and Turkiye to restore diplomatic ties,"The Turkish foreign minister attributed the decade-long rift to a lack of dialogue and misunderstandings Egypt and Turkiye are planning to hold talks about restoring ambassador-level relations in what could mark a rapprochement after a decade of frayed ties between the two nations. I m very glad that we are taking concrete steps for normalizing relations with Egypt... We will do our best not to rupture our ties again in future, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday during a visit to Cairo. His Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry, added that the countries would have talks on restoring ambassadors at the appropriate time. The Turkish minister blamed the longstanding rift on misunderstandings and a lack of dialogue, while acknowledging the impact it had on both countries. There is a huge level of untapped potential, but we have lost those nine years, and in order to close this nine-year gap, we have to work even harder, Cavusoglu said, hinting at a possible official meeting between the two countries presidents, Turkey s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In addition to seeking to upgrade diplomatic relations, Cavusoglu expressed both sides' commitment to advancing ties in the areas of energy, trade, and transportation. We want to improve our cooperation in the energy field, we want to take concrete steps ... There were some disruptions in transportation issues. We want to revive them. We want to maximize our diplomatic relations, Cavusoglu said, as reported by the Turkish media outlet Anadolu. Relations between the North African nation and Turkiye deteriorated after Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi, a supporter of Ankara and leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown in 2013 by el-Sisi, who was commander-in-chief of the Egyptian army at the time. The following year el-Sisi won the presidential election. Senior foreign ministry officials from Ankara and Cairo began talking in 2021 as Turkiye sought to defuse tensions with Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. The two nations have recently been at odds over maritime borders in the gas-rich Eastern Mediterranean and also over Libya, where they have supported opposing forces in the unresolved conflict. Egypt has been experiencing an economic downturn from which it has been attempting to extract itself through a variety of diplomatic means aimed at attracting foreign investment. The Egyptian foreign minister stated that improving Turkish-Egyptian relations would be in both countries best interests. There were Turkish investments in various fields in Egypt. In the past years, the trade volume between the two countries has increased to $9 billion. This is an important figure for both countries. In fact, Turkiye s investments in Egypt had reached $2.5 billion, he stressed. In February, a group of Turkish businessmen met with Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, the first such meeting in ten years. The Turkish delegation stated its intention to increase investment in Egypt by an additional $500 million this year. The Egyptian prime minister guaranteed that investors would enjoy a secure business environment. ",https://www.rt.com/africa/573227-egypt-turkiye-restoring-diplomatic-relations/
"18 Mar, 2023",The battle for African hearts and minds: Here's why the West is upset about Russia's growing influence on the continent,"As France continues to lose influence, Moscow and Washington compete to take its place On Sunday, March 19, the 2nd International Parliamentary Conference 'Russia Africa' willstartin Moscow. Over 40 official delegations from all over the continent will participate in the event, with discussions ranging from Russian-African cooperation to Western neocolonialism. The forum is just one link in a long chain of recent contacts between officials in Moscow and their African counterparts that will culminate in the second Russia-Africa Summit, scheduled for July of this year in St. Petersburg. Moscowhopesthat the event will elevate its relations with the countries involved to a new level of cooperation. Based on recent meetings between Russian diplomats and their African counterparts, it is clear that the new relations will be marked not only by economic, but also military partnership. The US and its allies have expressed concern over the issue and, as the Russian Foreign Ministrywarns,have attempted to disrupt the upcoming summit. But is this something the West can achieve, considering its slackening grip on the developing world? Moscow demonstrated its serious interest in the world s fastest-growing region, Africa, at the end of the last decade. The first Russia Africa Summit, held in Sochi in 2019, gathered representatives from all 54 African countries, with 43 states being represented at the highest level. Eight major integration associations and organizations also participated. The eventcostthe Russian authorities 4.5 billion rubles ($69 million) and was one of the most expensive of its kind. However, the investments paid off a hundredfold by the end of the summit, the sidessignedcontracts worth at least 800 billion rubles ($12 billion). Following the military offensive in Ukraine and the rupture of relations between Russia and the West, contacts with the Global South have become even more valuable for Russia. This is evidenced by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov s recent activity. In the first months of 2023, he has already toured Africa twice. At the end of January, he visited several sub-Saharan countries: South Africa, Eswatini (Swaziland), Angola, and Eritrea. In February, he traveled around North Africa to Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan. Lavrov s previous large-scale tour of Africa was in July 2022 and included Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, and the Republic of the Congo. Moreover, in the first months of 2023, his deputies held meetings with the ambassadors of African states in Moscow, while Russian ambassadors to African countries met with local authorities. In addition to discussions of the forthcoming Russia Africa Summit, Lavrov s recent encounters with African representatives focused on cooperation on food and energy security and military partnership. In South Africa, the minister discussed joint trilateral naval exercises with China, whichtook placein the Indian Ocean from February 17 to 27. For these exercises, a Russian Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate crossed the Atlantic. In Angola, Lavrovrecalledthe successful launch of the Angosat-2 satellite by Roscosmos in October 2022. He assured the authorities of further high-tech cooperation, expressed happiness at the growing interest in the Russian language, and spoke about creating common currencies within the framework of institutions like BRICS. In Eritrea, Lavrovstatedthat Moscow is ready to meet the country s needs in the matter of maintaining defense capabilities and developing military-technical cooperation. In Mali, the Russian Ministerdiscussedthe joint fight against terrorism in the Sahel-Saharan zone, the education of Malian students through the Russian Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the ongoing supply of weapons and military equipment. In Mauritania, the partiesdiscussedRussian tech transfers and cooperation in healthcare, including training Mauritanian students at Russian medical universities and the work of Russian doctors in the country. With Sudanese leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, a preliminary agreement wasmaderegarding the construction of a Russian naval base on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. These events received broadcoveragein Western media and apparently became a source of concern for the bloc's politicians. Soon afterwards, the West embarked on its own series of contacts with African countries. In December 2022, at a press conference on the eve of a US-Africa Summit forum, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austinclaimedthat the growing influence of Russia and China in Africa could destabilize the region. Backing loud statements with action, the United Statespromisedto allocate $55 billion to African countries. Indeed, at the beginning of 2023, the United Statesconductedjoint military exercises with 32 African countries in the Atlantic Ocean. There were alsoreportsof US plans for a military base in Morocco, which would be used to limit the influence of Russia and China in Africa. In March, the United States openly called on African countries to limit partnership with Russia, tying this to the conflict in Ukraine. Our goal, frankly, is to make very clear to these countries, from an economic standpoint, that your economic interests are aligned with Russia s invasion of Ukraine ending as soon as possible, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemosaid. In March, Adeyemo is scheduled to pay an official visit to Ghana, Nigeria, and one other African country. In her turn, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen already traveled to Senegal, Zambia, and South Africa in January. Washington's contacts with Africa are not limited to officials from the Department of Treasury. In February, First Lady Jill Biden herself paid a diplomaticvisitto Namibia and Kenya. The series of US visits is scheduled to continue with the trip of Vice President Kamala Harris, who will visit Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia from March 25 to April 2. According tothe Special Representative of the President of Russia for the Middle East and Africa, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, the United States and its allies are waging an unprecedented campaign to politically and economically isolate Russia, and also disrupt the second Russia-Africa Summit in St. Petersburg this July. Incidentally, Bogdanov mentioned not just the US, but also its partners since another country has been very active (even if less successfully) in Africa lately France. In early March, French President Emmanuel Macron visited four Central African states during a week-long tour: Gabon, Angola, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). During the trip, hestatedthat the Fran√ßafrique era, during which Paris exercised an informal guardianship over its former colonies, is now over and has given way to a new harmonious partnership. According to Macron, this new partnership implies a noticeable reduction of French military personnel in Africa, the reorganization of military bases, and a new model of military cooperation. However, these statements look a lot more like the inevitable acceptance of reality than a gesture of free will. In recent years, Paris has decided to withdraw troops from the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali, and Burkina Faso. The decision was preceded not only by mass anti-French demonstrations by the local population, but also by Russia s growing ties with these states. The most striking example of French failure is the Central African Republic. France took home its troops only in December last year. For many years, Paris used various means, including military, to intervene in the country s national politics by supporting or removing its presidents. When in 2012, civil war broke out between the government and insurgents, peacekeepers from France and other EU countries unsuccessfully tried to end the conflict. In 2018, CAR authorities turned to Russia for help andsignedan agreement on military cooperation. Moscow supplied the republic with ammunition, trained the local military, and gradually increased the number of military instructors in the country. Less than a year after Russia intervened, the authorities managed to negotiate a truce with several local groups. CAR authorities later expressedgratitudeto Russia for its role in the peacemaking process. The success of Russian weapons and diplomacy was converted into economic benefits. In 2020, Russian companies were givenpermissionto mine gold and diamonds in the Central African Republic. Not long ago, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central African Republic, Sylvie Baipo-Temon, openlystatedthat the mistakes of France had cleared the path for Russia. Events in Mali played out in a similar manner. At the request of the local authorities, French troops had been fighting Muslim insurgents since 2013. But the situation only got worse over time. Finally, the leaders of the military juntarequestedRussian assistance in fighting the insurgents associated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. As a result, Russian military instructors trained the local army and helped fight the militants. In general, France is losing its military and diplomatic presence in Africa. Maliexpelledthe French ambassador in early 2022, and by August, French troops werewithdrawnto neighboring Niger. In September 2022, a military coup occurred in Burkina Faso, and in January the new government demanded French troops leave the country. Thousands of demonstratorsgatheredin Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, to support the new government just several days after Paris confirmed the withdrawal of its troops from the country. The protesters reportedly carried the flags of Burkina Faso and Russia. The newspaper Vzglyadreportsthat the coup in Burkina Faso resulted in Niger s first officially authorized protest in fifty years. The demonstrators shouted the slogans,""France out!""and""Long live Putin and Russia!"" The French publication Le Point put a tellingheadlineon its article summarizing the events in Africa: France shown out the door, a red carpet spread before Russia. The article notes that the situation was caused by public skepticism regarding the ability and willingness of the French troops to protect the people in Mali and Burkina Faso. According to French media sources, only 2,000 French military remained in Niger, 500 in Senegal, and another 900 on the C√¥te d'Ivoire. During his speech in Benin immediately after Lavrov's summer tour of Africa, Macronattemptedto throw shade at Moscow by labeling it one of the last imperial colonial powers. The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, echoed him andvoicedconcerns about the demonstrations in Mali. I saw on TV these young African people walking the streets of Bamako with posters saying ‚ÄòPutin, thank you! You saved Donbass and now you will save us! . It s shocking, he said. Former US Special Envoy J. Peter Phamtoldthe FT that the collective West has lost its influence in certain African countries due to its unwillingness to cooperate in the military-technical field. In particular, he noted that the US State Department vetoed the sale of an Airbus transport aircraft equipped with an American-made transponder to Mali. The Malian Ministry of Foreign Affairs thus agreed to receive both equipment and military aid from Moscow. According toThe Times, the US and the former powers Britain and France have been losing their grip on Africa, while Moscow and Beijing are expanding their presence in the region. ""Russia's growing influence highlights the evolving relationships on the world's fastest-growing continent [Africa], the newspaper reports. The authors claim that Moscow can count on Africa, which has long been the playground of the great world powers, to support it at the global level and particularly at the UN. The Times added that the goal of the US Africa Summit was to lure African leaders into joining the Western side. But the renewed fight for Africa may already be lost considering the expanding presence of Russia and China in the region. Incidentally, compared to the West, Russia is a lot more restrained in assessing its prospects in Africa. A number of experts believe that Moscow s increasing military presence there is not a solid enough foundation for successful Russian-African relations. Anthropologist and host of the Telegram channel African Behemoth Artyom Rykov notes that in order to secure its influence and gain new allies on the continent, Russia needs more than just a military presence. It needs to establish large-scale joint cultural and economic projects with African countries, which, as of now, do not exist. It s about informal ties. For example, understanding where local elites spend their free time and where they educate their children. It s also about trade finding a market for our goods in an African country. It s also important to understand what kind of goods we re talking about, Rykov said. Grigory Lukyanov, a researcher at the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), is also confident about establishing cooperation between Russia and Africa in various fields in order to build partnerships. He believes that bilateral relations are currently in need of specific economic projects and a more systematic approach. According to Lukyanov, Africa's current sympathy for Russia is mainly rooted in anti-Western sentiments. The anti-French, anti-British, anti-colonial agenda is once again dominant in Africa. It has gained supporters who are ready, able, and willing to loudly discuss it and receive major political benefits from it. But does this really mean that the region has become more pro-Russian? Lukyanov wonders. The researcher believes that pro-Russian views based on anti-American, anti-European, anti-French, and anti-British sentiments cannot be considered a stable model. The absence of a constructive agenda will soon become apparent. If France or the United States leave a particular country, the pro-Russian views will lose their foundation. If you can't hate someone together, why should you be friends? Why should you love or at least tolerate and understand each other? he says. Artyom Rykov believes that Western media and politicians are aware of this and discuss the threat posed by Russia in a preventive sort of manner. In reality, he notes, we cannot say that Russia has come to replace the West in Africa. Representatives of the African elite aren t quick to express such views either. In an interview with RT France, in response to the question Does Burkina Faso want Russia to replace France? the Prime Minister said, Our goal is to have more opportunities. It s not to have someone replace somebody else. It s also worth noting that most African countries refrain from publicly taking sides in the conflict between Russia and the West. This is the true reason (and not Africa s alleged sympathy toward Russia) why the region does not support anti-Russian sanctions, as noted by the Washington Post back in December. However, Lukyanov says, Russia does not need to win the favor of African countries. Russia needs partnerships with African countries. He believes that Russia and Africa need mutually beneficial relations not in order to extract resources or win votes in the UN, but to establish partnerships within a new and just world order one that would replace the current crisis. Lukyanov is confident that the course of events in Russia, Africa, and the world both in the coming decade and in the 21st century in general will depend on effectively achieving this task. According to many experts, we currently stand at the beginning of a long journey and may only anticipate the results of Russia's activities in Africa. As Lukyanov emphasizes, a lot of work is still necessary especially in the quad aspects of church, society, state, and business before we are able to discuss major results in the long term.

"18 Mar, 2023",NATO bombed Libya to protect civilians 12 years ago. This led to thousands of deaths and a country in ruins,"The Western war machine only served its own interests in destroying a nation that could liberate Africa ByMoussa Ibrahim, spokesperson of the Libyan Government and Minister of Media, 2011 ByMoussa Ibrahim, spokesperson of the Libyan Government and Minister of Media, 2011 On the 19th of March 2011, the NATO bloc began a violent 8-month long military onslaught of Libya, a sovereign African-Union founding member state, which had enjoyed four decades of stability, prosperity and one of the highest Human Development Index (HDI) scores in all of Africa. NATO s justification for the aggressive and bloody attack was the now-infamous protection of civilians'' doctrine, formalized under UN Security Council Decree No. 1973. The French Air Force, however, had already initiated a major raid on immobile Libyan Army units. They had already pulled out of the city of Benghazi, a protest hotbed, in a show of goodwill and peaceful intent. More than 400 resting Libyan officers, soldiers, medical and media personnel were massacred without the chance to fight back against an unjustified and undeclared foreign air attack. Tens of thousands more Libyans would later perish under more than 26,000 air raids, 100 cruise missile attacks and a naval blockade conducted by NATO s 30-member coalition. Among the victims were a terrifying number of civilians from all walks of life. The number of women and children killed was especially high, as they sought refuge in civilian buildings deliberately targeted by the mighty NATO: including houses, apartment blocks, schools and community centers. As we witnessed time and time again in Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan and Syria, NATO justified these attacks by claiming they were seeking out fighters and weaponry housed in civilian facilities. No evidence has ever been presented. In the weeks that led up to this aggression, I spoke officially for the Libyan Government in countless international press conferences, media appearances and diplomatic appeals. Before hundreds of international media outlets, I expressed one single demand: that all hostilities cease under the direct supervision of the UN and that the African Union installs an international fact-finding mission to determine who committed what act, paving the way for a national conference of all Libyan parties to the conflict. This single most powerful and earnest appeal was rejected without consideration in Western centers of hegemony and ridiculed in Western media outlets. The only solutions that were endorsed and praised were more rockets, bombs and the continuous arming of Islamist and tribalist terrorist groups on the ground. In the years after, crimes against humanity charges against the revolutionary government of Libya were either never proven or were shown to have been false. In fact, given its 12 years of total control over Libya (land, resources, institutions and archives), the West has been unable to show the alleged 8,000victims of rapeby the Libyan army, nor the 10,000 murdered civilians, nor the neighbourhoods of Tripoli allegedly destroyed by Muammar Gaddafi s air force, nor the African mercenaries supposedly imported by the Gaddafi government in the first week of the Libyan Spring (15-22 February 2011). The actual crimes of the Libyan revolutionary Government, however, were real and consequential: Gaddafi s Libya was re-shaping the political, economic and cultural context of the African continent in radical and independent ways not seen since the nominal de-colonization of African countries in the 1950s and 1960s. On September 9, 1999, under the leadership of Gaddafi, the establishment of the African Union was announced in his birthplace, the coastal city of Sirte (the very city in which he would fight his last battle against NATO in 2011). Gaddafi then announced the start of a major revolutionary project for the plundered and exploited continent: building pan-African economic, security and communication institutions with the aim of gaining complete and true independence from the control of the West. The most consequential of these institutions were the African Central Bank (ACB), the African Golden Dinar, the African Gold Reserve, the African Security Council (ASC), the Unified African Army (UAA), the African Parliament, the African Organisation for Natural Resources (AONR), the African Communications Network (ACN) and the African Common Market. Indeed, Gaddafi led the way towards the establishment of some of those institutions, initiated the build-up of the Libyan gold reserve and was on the threshold of issuing the African Golden Dinar, which he considered naming the Afro. These real on-the-ground projects would have liberated the continent from the dominance of Western centers of power and monopoly, transforming global economic structures and inspiring other regions in the Global South to unite, organize and fight . The Europeans and Americans did warn Gaddafi against his meddling in Africa. The US, under an African-American president, hurried to create AfriCom, the American pan-African military force, in 2008. The French followed suit with their deployment of an anti-terrorism task force in the Sahel. Moreover, the intensity with which the continent s riches were stolen increased (especially gold) while the meddling of British, French and American diplomats in the affairs of the African Union and African Parliament also grew exponentially. The focus of Western mainstream media in the 2000s on a new and collaborative spirit in economic relations with Africa was therefore not accidental it was all as planned and in harmony with the military, economic and political agenda in Western centers of power. Then, in 2011, utilizing the political turmoil in Tunisia and Egypt, the West encouraged and ordered its agents on the ground in Libya to foment a false revolution in small pockets inside the country. This was spearheaded by the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an infamous Afghani-Libyan terrorist organization with training and weaponry from the American army and battlefield commanders trained and exalted by NATO s top educational personnel in the caves of Afghanistan in the 1980s and early 1990s. The West promised the world democracy, human rights, and prosperity for Libya and the whole Sahel and Sahara region in Africa. Instead, by the 12th anniversary of the NATO onslaught, Libya itself had become a notorious slave market for illegally imported African migrants and a battlefield for French-orchestrated African Sahel tribalist conflicts (in Chad, Niger, Mali). The country that once led Africa s liberation project now lies in ruins, with 10 foreign-controlled military bases scattered across its territory, hosting more than 20,000 foreign troops and mercenaries, and bearing$576 billion in financial lossessince the start of NATO s intervention. Over 60,000 additional Libyans have been killed in the ongoing civil conflict, fuelled and maintained by mostly foreign and Western-sponsored forces fighting for their interests and dominance on the Libyan front. All sectors of the Libyan economy and society (education, health, housing, employment and living standards) have been devastated, dismantled and ravaged by 12 years of Western-funded conflict and political turmoil. As for Africa as a whole, the great African Union has lost its edge after a total freeze on most of the aforementioned projects of liberation, from the African Golden Dinar to the Unified African Army. In fact, the West s exploitative economic, political and military presence in Africa has only increased since the murder of Gaddafi, a true testimony to the very reason he was assassinated. In the last few weeks, the UN Security Council has appointed the 8th Special Representative to Libya since 2011, Mr. Abdoulaye Bathily. Mr. Bathily has been conducting the same routine visits to the warlords and their militias in Libya, holding the same routine political and press conferences and reiterating the same old Security Council discourse: we are here to bring democracy and prosperity to all Libyans, and we shall defend human rights and protect civilians. Those who oppose this political process will be brought before international justice. The only problem is that Mr. Bathily is speaking as if this is the first day of the first year of the Libyan tragedy. He does not bother to mention that it is instead the 12th Anniversary of the devastation of a developed, prosperous and stable African nation. Furthermore, he doesn t bother to highlight the simple fact that foreign military powers and mercenaries are present and active in Libya, something at least acknowledged by his predecessor, Stephanie Williams. However, there is always hope for the great black continent. The legacy of its great leaders and martyrs from Gamal Nasser to Patrice Lumumba to Kwame Nkrumah to Nelson Mandela continues to inspire African consciousness, struggle and resistance. In the last few months, for example, a major popular movement has been building up in Western Africa to end all Western military presence in the Sahel region, with governments starting to slowly but steadily heed these calls for liberation and sovereignty. Wherever you go in Africa nowadays, you can hear the literal words and viable ideas of Gaddafi coming up in conversations about African liberty, independence and dignity. In my work with the Libyan Green Resistance and the African popular movements, I am always faced by this question raised by thousands of African freedom fighters: what to do? My answer is always straight and simple to all my African comrades: unite, organize and fight!",https://www.rt.com/africa/573132-nato-bombed-libya-africa/
"17 Mar, 2023",How does the China-brokered Saudi-Iranian normalization affect Israel?,"The restoration of diplomatic relations could derail the strategy of uniting the region against a common threat Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . A key goal of both the Israeli and American governments is to foster the normalization of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and part of the strategy to make this happen was to unite the two against what has been depicted as a common enemy, Iran. The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement now appears to have thrown a spanner in the works of such efforts, and hence enraged the Israelis. After five rounds of talks throughout the span of two years, Iran and Saudi Arabia were unable to reach a compromise for the re-establishment of diplomatic ties, something China has now managed to broker in a shocking turn of events. Based upon the long rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh, US and Israeli policy towards Saudi Arabia has been based on combating a common enemy shared between all sides. Although the US government itself has not reacted with open animosity to the sudden change in regional dynamics, the Israelis are publicly interpreting this as a negative development. In June 2022, the Wall Street Journalreportedthat a previously undisclosed meeting had taken place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, whereby a number of Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, had met with the Israeli military chief of staff at the time, Aviv Kochavi. Part of the discussions that took place was allegedly geared towards forming anIsraeli-Arab defense alliance. Although no such alliance was formed, it was largely speculated at the time that US President Joe Biden s visit to both Israel and Saudi Arabia the following month would include discussions on this topic. Despite the failure of the US and Israel so far to put together such an alliance, it is clear that part of the strategy for achieving normalization has been to secure defense interests. Across the Israeli political spectrum, from both the coalition government and opposition, fingerpointinghas been taking place, in attempts to pin the blame for the perceived failure of Israel to prevent Saudi-Iranian normalization. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has attempted to shift the blame onto the former government, an idea refuted by former Israeli Mossad head Efraim Halevy as factually incorrect. On the other hand, former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett has called the agreement a serious and dangerous development for Israel. Yair Lapid, another former PM and current leader of the opposition,also saidit is an utter and dangerous failure of the Israeli government s foreign policy. The big question now is whether the Chinese-brokered normalization agreement will negatively impact potential normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Reuters reported that, according to an unnamed seniorIsraeli official, the Saudi-Iranian deal will have no significant impact on Israeli-Saudi relations. It is also not clear whether the agreement has any clauses to do with Israeli normalization.According to Carmiel Arbitfrom the Washington-based Atlantic Council, the Saudis could be attempting to conduct a balancing act the way the United Arab Emirates has. The UAE, which signed its own normalization deal with Israel in 2020, hassince 2019managed to de-escalate tensions with Iran and is currently maintaining cordial ties with both sides. It is not clear, however, whether the model of Abu Dhabi will be applicable for the Saudis. Riyadh, simply put, has a lot more to lose than the Emiratis, due to its wide regional entanglements and domestic constraints, and hence it has chosen to maintain a distance from the Israelis at this time. The internal political crisis in Tel Aviv may also play a crucial role in the Saudi decision to push forward with the normalization of ties with Iran, as instability within Israel, coupled with a potential escalation in the conflict with the Palestinian people, could severely hinder a formal diplomatic breakthrough. One crucial result of Saudi-Iranian normalization, however, is not necessarily to do with Israel s own relations with the Saudis. Combating Iran, specifically its nuclear program through coercive measures, is an active policy position on both sides of the political divide in Israel. Netanyahu placed the issue of combating Iran, even through direct force, at the forefront of his campaign to win the election late last year. Throughout the past unity coalition of Bennett and Lapid, the anti-Iran position also proved a cornerstone of Israeli regional policy. Performing aggressive actions, such as a direct attack against Iranian nuclear facilities, could now be much more difficult for the Israelis to pull off, with Saudi Arabia taking a non-combative approach to Iran. Although the nuclear issue is perhaps the most pervasive issue for the Israeli public, Iran s regional alliances and defense programs are the true threats posed to Israel. If Saudi-Iranian ties are able to flourish and the Chinese-brokered deal holds, this could mean that Riyadh s efforts in Lebanon against Hezbollah could be curtailed, and this surely represents a concern for Israel. Iran, through its relationships with regional political parties, governments, and localized militia forces, also possesses the ability to pull strings that could benefit Saudi Arabia if it reciprocates by doing the same. This is especially the case when it comes to the conflict in Yemen. One thing that Ansarallah, also known as the Houthis, have been able to prove in their efforts against the Saudi-led coalition since 2015 when the war began, is that they are capable of overcoming US-made defense equipment. Iran, as a close ally of Ansarallah, could aid in setting up a long-term truce or even lasting peace, which the likes of the US simply cannot offer. To end this war would be in the security interests of the Saudis, who will undoubtedly suffer if the violence resumes, especially if missiles and drones begin striking their vital infrastructure again. Just as Beijing proved capable of fostering Saudi-Iranian normalization, Tehran could offer the ability to properly negotiate a peaceful solution in Yemen. However, it is simply too early to tell whether such a development will take place. What the deal undoubtedly does is prove the weakness in Israel s regional capabilities, along with the waning influence of the US. Israel s security concerns regarding Syria and Lebanon may be heightened if the Chinese-brokered agreement delivers a more peaceful approach inside both of these nations. Saudi Arabia could also re-establish ties with the Syrian government, as the UAE has already done, which could help Damascus on the road to recovery from its brutal war and current state of economic ruin. A strong and united Syria could in the future also pose a strategic threat to Israel. While Saudi-Israeli normalization is by no means off the table, the Saudi-Iranian agreement could pose a serious challenge regionally for Israel s current policy approach.",https://www.rt.com/news/573099-saudi-iran-china-israel-relations/
"16 Mar, 2023",African nation wants to join BRICS,"Zimbabwe considers the group a new force in international relations, a senior politician says The Zimbabwean government would like to become a member of the BRICS economic bloc, the speaker of the ruling party ZANU-PF said on Wednesday. We made it clear that we would like to become a member of the BRICS, Christopher Mutsvangwa told Russia s RIA Novosti news agency. The official added that his country is interested in developing alternatives to the Western-dominated SWIFT payment network. In his view, BRICS could contribute to that. Mutsvangwa described BRICS as a new force in international relations, and said he hopes its growth and expansion will continue. The five BRICS nations Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa account for more than 40% of the world s population and nearly a quarter of global GDP. Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that more than a dozen nations have expressed an interest in entering the BRICS alliance.

"15 Mar, 2023",Ukraine left out of 'unprecedented' World Cup announcement,"Spain and Portugal have been joined by Morocco, according to a statement from the North African country's king Morocco has announced that it s joining Spain and Portugal s bid to stage the 2030 FIFA World Cup, apparently replacing Ukraine in the trio of potential hosts. Madrid and Lisbon filed their joint candidacy in 2021, and last October added Kiev to their bid, saying they wanted to give hope to the Ukrainians amid the conflict with Russia. Back then, Portuguese Football Federation chief Fernando Gomes explained that the gesture was a way to contribute through the power of football to the recovery of a country undergoing reconstruction. However, on Wednesday, Morocco s Sports Minister Chakib Benmoussa read out a message from Moroccan King Mohammed VI in Rwanda s capital Kigali, where FIFA is hosting its 73rd congress. The Kingdom of Morocco has decided, together with Spain and Portugal, to present a joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup, the message read. This joint bid, which is unprecedented in football history, will bring together Africa and Europe, the northern and southern Mediterranean, and the African, Arab and Euro-Mediterranean worlds, the king said. The royal message did not mention Ukraine, so it remains unclear whether Kiev has been excused from the bid altogether, or if the application will be expanded to four nations. When asked to comment on the announcement from Rabat, a spokesman for the Spanish Football Association said the country s football chief will meet with his Portuguese and Moroccan counterparts later on Wednesday. The presidents will announce any news regarding the candidacy for the 2030 World Cup in Kigali, the spokesman clarified. He did not mention Ukraine s potential involvement. The Moroccan football squad made huge waves at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar a few months ago, knocking out Spain and Portugal in the playoffs to become the first African country to reach the semifinals. Spain is only separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, while the distance between Ukraine and the Iberian Peninsula, where both Spain and Portugal are located, is several thousand kilometers. The other contenders to host the World Cup in seven years are a joint Latin American bid from Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay, and another transcontinental application from Saudi Arabia, Greece, and Egypt.

"13 Mar, 2023",Ukraine is third-largest global arms importer study,"Weapon transfers to Europe rose sharply in 2022, while arms trade across the world declined, a Stockholm-based think tank has found The US and EU s extensive military aid to Kiev amid its ongoing conflict with Moscow made Ukraine the third largest importer of major arms in 2022, after Qatar and India, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on Monday. Ukraine also ranked as the 14th largest weapons importer in the world for the five-year period between 2018 and 2022, accounting for some 2% of global arms imports, the think tank found. While the global level of international arms transfers has fallen by 5.1% in the past five years, SIPRI also reported that imports of arms by European states saw a sharp increase of 47%, while European NATO states increased their weapon imports by 65% amid a perceived threat from Russia. Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to tensions between Russia and most other European states, noted Pieter D. Wezeman, a senior SIPRI researcher, adding that European states now want to import more arms, faster. He also observed that, while the US and other NATO states have declined Kiev s requests for combat aircraft and long-range missiles out of fears of an escalation in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, they have nevertheless supplied such arms to other states involved in the conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. Russia and the US have remained the biggest weapons exporters in the world, although Moscow s share of arms sales reportedly fell from 22% to 16% while Washington s share saw an increase from 33% to 40%. Also, between 2018 and 2022, US arms sales grew by 14%, while Russia s sales fell by 31%. Meanwhile, Asia and Oceania accounted for 41% of arms deliveries in 2018-2022, with countries like India, Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan landing in the top ten of global arms importers. Wesman explained that the increased demand is being driven by a perceived growing threat from China and North Korea. As for the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt found themselves in the top ten of weapons importers for the past five years, with the great majority of weapons being provided by the USA (54%), followed by France, Russia and Italy. The sales included over 260 advanced combat aircraft, over 500 new tanks and 13 frigates, SIPRI reported. ",https://www.rt.com/news/572895-global-arms-import-ranking/
"10 Mar, 2023","Pentagon scrambles to save US interests in Middle East, but it might be too late","The Defense Secretary s tour of the region shows Washington s unwillingness to evolve Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Ahead of anticipated regional escalations in the coming months, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin landedin the Kingdom of Jordanon Sunday, kickstarting yet another high-profile Middle East visit this year. Despite Washington s efforts to impose its agenda, its current approach may prove to be too out of touch to make a tangible difference. The Pentagon Chief arrived in the Jordanian capital on a tour aimed at assuring regional allies of US policy commitments, despite the Biden administration's focus on combating Russia and China. Austin s visit was originally tailored to be geared towards visiting Tel Aviv, Cairo and Amman, but has also included a surprise visit to Baghdad. The visit is the second high-profile US Middle East tour this year, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken also leading a delegation to the Holy Land in late January. Unfortunately for Blinken, his delegation's visit, which partially focused on calming tensions in the occupied Palestinian territories, has so far proven to have been a flop, with violence continuing to escalate in the West Bank. Austin faces a challenge ahead of what is expected to be a month of escalated violence in the occupied territories between the Israeli military and Palestinians during the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan, which begins at the end of March. Some of the stops on Austin s tour appear to be specifically tailored towards preventing this violence. The problem already presenting itself is the lack of a targeted focus on any key aim, combined with a disconnect from realities on the ground. The Hashemite Ruler of Jordan, King Abdullah II, holds legal custodianship over the Al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding Muslim and Christian holy sites inside the Old City of Jerusalem. Provocations earlier this year, caused by Israel s Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir s approval of anincursioninto Al-Aqsa Mosque, sparked a verbal bout at a UN security council session convened to condemn any violation of the status quo. Despite Jordan s peace treaty and close security ties with Israel, there was enmity over al-Aqsa between the Jordanian ruler and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during former US President Donald Trump s time in office. If the situation deteriorates further this could challenge Israel-Jordan relations. Jordan is also a close ally of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and plays an integral role in maintaining security coordination between the PA and Israeli security forces in the West Bank. Asecurity summitin Aqaba, Jordan, in late February brought together delegations from the PA, Israel, Egypt and the US. The meeting focused on a US plan to help the PA s security forces re-establish control over the northern West Bank, and combat newly formed armed Palestinian groups in the area. The proposal, put forth by US Security coordinator, Michael Fenzel, aims at training a PA force in Jordan to counter the armed groups. However, the plan lacks an appreciation of facts on the ground, in particular popular dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority, and could prove counterproductive, by triggering an armed conflict between the groups and PA Security forces. Austin s visit to Egypt could be integral in helping calm armed movements in the Gaza Strip, as Cairo plays a key intermediary role between Israel and the Hamas government. In addition, it is important to note that Qatar sMohammed al-Emadi, responsible for coordinating aid grants to Gaza,visitedthe besieged coastal enclave on Monday specifically to discuss a new grant. Historically, Qatari aid, as well as Egypt s ability to ease the siege by opening the Rafah crossing, have been used as bargaining chips with Hamas, to prevent or end escalations with Israel. However, in spite of attempts by neighboring Arab nations to prevent an escalation, the situation is almost entirely dependent upon Israel s approach towards the Palestinians. If aggressive measures are taken against Muslim worshippers around the Old City of Jerusalem, as is being suggested by prominent ministers in the Israeli government, this may not only trigger a reaction from Palestinians, but also tensions with Jordan. Depending upon how far things go, it may even isolate Egypt from Israel. This is why the US must drop its policy of unconditional support for Israel. Tel Aviv has historically seen a lack of consequences for its actions as a green light for aggression. If we look at the US State Department'sstatementon Antony Blinken s visit, along with the focus of influential Washington based think-tanks, it becomes clear that the Biden administration isfixatedon achieving an Israeli-Saudi normalization deal. Such a deal could be within reach. However, a failure to prevent an escalation in the coming months, especially around the al-Aqsa mosque issue, could seriously jeopardize the White House's desired result. The Pentagon chief's surprisevisitto Baghdad on Tuesday was geared towards expanding US-Iraqi cooperation in the fight against Islamic State terrorists. The visit again demonstrates Washington s desperation to stick to the same policy approach it did in the past, namely of deepening the dependence of countries in the region on the US for security. Similarly, the US policy to bring Saudi Arabia under its wing has for years revolved around military backing for the Kingdom. The problem in this case is that the war in Yemen represents a US failure to actually protect Saudi Arabia. The inability of the Biden administration to end the war has resulted in the renewal of armed conflict along the Saudi-Yemen border. Last month, Baghdad signed new oil and gas deals with two Chinese firms, along with the UAE s Crescent Petroleum. Saudi Arabia and Iran have also both formallyappliedto join the BRICS economic alliance in the last month. Attempts to isolate and protect Washington s Arab allies from Tehran haven t worked, and the Iranian government is only expanding its economic and military ties. It is also becoming increasingly clear that US and Israeli military technology is not the best way to deal with Tehran. Instead, dialogue and cooperation, something that Abu Dhabi is currently engaged in, is yielding better results. The US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 marked the beginning of a new era in the Middle East in terms of the way American power is expressed. Washington s ability to directly attack those it opposes in the region has been severely curtailed, resulting in it relying on proxy wars and attempts to stir chaos from within the civil societies of its target nations. The days of complete US dominance by force have ended, and the strength of regional forces opposing the US, resulting from Iran s military ingenuity, has created a new power balance. For the US to maintain its role as a dominant power in the region, it must evolve in its approach, dropping the failed aggressor stance. It must also change its approach to Israel, as the current policy of never holding their ally accountable may jeopardize further normalization deals and destabilize the entire region further. Allowing Israel to repeatedly violate its own red lines on issues like the al-Aqsa mosque, settlement expansion and home demolitions, has made Washington a non-credible intermediary between Israel and the Palestinians. It has created a situation where a number of armed groups now play the role as representatives of the Palestinian quest for statehood.

According to Reuters, Austin s visit was kept a secret until he landed due to security concerns. The secretary is currently on a multi-nation tour of the region. Austin s visit comes just two weeks ahead of the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq that ousted the country s leader Saddam Hussein and led to two decades of brutal fighting. The 2003 invasion led to the death of between 180,000 to 210,000 civilians, according to the Iraq Body Count project, while the instability caused by the toppling of the Iraqi government and the withdrawal of US forces in 2011 ultimately led to the rise of Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL. US troops returned to the country in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government to combat ISIS. However, after the terrorist group was mostly suppressed, the US decided to keep 2,500 of its troops stationed in Iraq and 900 in Syria. That s despite the Iraqi parliament voting to expel all foreign troops after the US assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. Then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted at the time that the Iraqi people wanted the US to remain on their soil, and that Washington""will continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous US Defense official, Austin is expected to tell the Iraqi government during his visit that the US remains committed to retain its forces' presence in the country. But it's not just about the military instrument. The United States is broadly interested in a strategic partnership with the government of Iraq,""he said. Prior to his trip to Baghdad, Austin also met with Jordan s King Abdullah ll in that country's capital, Amman. There he warned of unthinkable military ties developing between Russia and Iran, and reassured regional allies that Washington remains committed to the Middle East for the long haul. The defense secretary is also expected to visit US allies Egypt and Israel, where he also plans to raise Washington s concerns over Iran s ties with Russia, as well as China s growing interest in the region.

"27 Feb, 2023",Russia no longer at mercy of global elite Lavrov,"Moscow will determine its own external conditions for development, the diplomat said Western political leaders will no longer have the power to dictate terms to Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. Speaking with the heads of the ministry s regional offices, the diplomat stressed that Russia will now determine its own needs for development. Until recently, a couple of years ago, the external conditions that we needed for development were determined not by us, but by the Western minority, said Lavrov. He added that all the foreign policy initiatives promoted by the so-called golden billion group serve the sole purpose of making sure that the world lives by rules that allow Western elites to continue their colonial policies and live at the expense of others. Therefore, we will no longer rely on someone when it comes to creating the external conditions for the development that we need, Lavrov stressed, also pledging that Russia will not follow in the footsteps of the selfish West, and will take into account the interests of other independent states. According to the diplomat, Moscow aims to create external conditions that are as favorable as possible for the development of the country, but stressed that these conditions must also reflect the consensus of all independent states and fully comply with the principles of the UN Charter, which have been repeatedly violated by our former Western colleagues. During the meeting, Lavrov also noted that the number of countries wishing to join BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) economic blocs had increased to almost two dozen by the end of 2022. The diplomat noted that the countries wishing to join the alliances, such as Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Argentina, Mexico and several African nations, play a very prominent role in their regions. Just listing the names of these states already shows the failure of attempts [of the West] to isolate our country, Lavrov observed, adding that the opposite has happened, with independent countries now uniting with other like-minded states.

"27 Feb, 2023",Analysts reveal voracious buyers of Russia s oil products WSJ,"North Africa boosts imports of Russian petroleum products, while volumes of oil refining remain the same, the newspaper says North African nations have sharply increased imports of Russian diesel and other refined oil products, while petrochemical exports from the region have seen a significant uptick, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing trading analysts. Industry experts are reportedly raising concerns that Russian sanctioned cargoes are being blended with other oil products and re-sold. The procedure effectively disguises the ultimate origin of the products, undermining Western states efforts to oust Russian fossil fuels from their economies. Imports of Russian diesel by Morocco soared to two million barrels in January compared with some 600,000 barrels recorded during the whole of 2021, according to analysts from commodities market data firm Kpler, who stress that a further 1.2 million barrels will be shipped to the country this month. Tunisia boosted purchases of Russian diesel, gas oil, gasoline and naphtha, which is traditionally used to make chemicals and plastics, to 2.8 million barrels in January and is projected to import another 3.1 million barrels in February. Kpler also recorded an uptick in imports by Algeria, Egypt and Libya. The volumes absorbed by North African countries are too much for them to take on their own, according to Viktor Katona, Kpler senior oil analyst, who predicts that some of the Russian products will make their way to Europe. Trust me, we are not witnessing some renaissance in Maghrebi refining, Katona told the Wall Street Journal, referring to the region of North Africa North African ports are seen as convenient for Russian cargoes sailing from the Baltic Sea, as voyages are not much longer than the pre-sanctions trips to European ports. This allows Russia to keep shipping costs low, and prevents its limited fleet of tankers from getting tied up in lengthy voyages to Asia or elsewhere. Even if you wanted to regulate that, how would you? Andreas Economou, head of oil research at The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, was quoted by the paper as saying. If a cargo is 51% from Morocco, 49% from Russia, how would you referee that? Some of North Africa s increased diesel imports from Russia have displaced the region s typical suppliers in the Middle East and North America, suggesting some of the activity was bargain hunting, Jorge Leon, senior vice president at Rystad Energy, told the newspaper. Earlier this week, EU sanctions envoy David O Sullivan told the Financial Times that the bloc and its allies had begun investigating a surge in exports to countries in Russia s neighbourhood. They suspected sanctioned products were entering Russia via the back door. The EU has introduced 10 rounds of anti-Russia sanctions since the beginning of Moscow s military operation in Ukraine. Kremlin has repeatedly said that the measures, supported by the US and its allies, are illegitimate and ineffective, and that the restrictions cause more damage to the initiators. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the penalties crazy and thoughtless, saying that no country had previously changed its political course due to sanctions pressure.

"26 Feb, 2023",Dozens dead after migrant shipwreck off Italy,"The boat is thought to have been carrying people from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan The bodies of more than 40 migrants have been found washed up on a beach in southern Italy after a vessel which was believed to be carrying in excess of 100 people broke apart off the coast on Sunday in rough weather. Initial reports say the bodies of 43 migrants believed to be from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan were found on the shore at Steccato di Cutro in the southern Italian province of Crotone, in Calabria. Further bodies were seen to be still in the water, while Italian media are reporting that as many as 70 people remain unaccounted for and around 80 have been rescued. Rescue attempts have been complicated by emergency services not having reliable information regarding the number of migrants on the vessel, but the death toll will certainly rise, according to the ANSA news agency with a months-old baby being reported among the dead. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has expressed her deep sorrow for the many human lives cut short by human traffickers following the incident, while also asking people not to speculate as to the number of people who lost their lives. She added that it was inhuman [for traffickers] to exchange the lives of men, women and children for money under the pretense of a safe journey for migrants to Europe. Mayor of Cutro Antonio Ceraso added that the area had never before encountered an incident as tragic as this. In the past there had been landings, he said. But never such a tragedy. Further updates are expected from Italian authorities on Sunday as a large search-and-rescue operation continues. In addition to the firefighters and the coast guard, border police were also involved in the rescue operation, as were divers and aquatic rescuers. The origin of the ship remains unclear, but migrants arriving in southern Italy often depart from either Turkiye or Egypt. Italy and Spain are popular destinations for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe. Estimates suggest that in excess of 100,000 migrants arrived in Italy in 2022, with these people predominantly coming from Egypt, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Syria and Afghanistan.

"22 Feb, 2023",Biden reacts to Russia suspending nuclear treaty,"Moscow s decision on New START is a big mistake, the US leader has said US President Joe Biden on Wednesday disapproved of Moscow s decision to suspend the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the two powers. In a speech to lawmakers the day prior, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move was in response to unacceptable and cynical moves by the West. Biden was wrapping up his visit to Ukraine and Poland with a photo-op in Warsaw when one of the reporters shouted a question about the treaty. I don t have time, the US president said at first. Pausing, he said, big mistake. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known in the US as New START and in Russia as SNV-III , was originally signed in 2010. Biden had agreed to extend it through 2026 during his first week in office. The US had previously withdrawn from the INF and Open Skies treaties, leaving New START as the last arms control agreement standing. Addressing the Russian legislature on Tuesday, Putin said Russia would be suspending its membership in New START, but not withdrawing from the treaty. He accused the US of trying to refashion the international order to suit exclusively its own needs and selfish interests, demanding that Moscow abide by treaties such as New START while they will do as they please and Western leaders publicly make statements about inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia. This is either the height of hypocrisy and cynicism, or the height of stupidity, but they are not idiots. They are not stupid, the Russian leader said. Putin pointed out that NATO which is not even a party to New START had made absurd demands to inspect the Russian nuclear deterrent, even as the US-led bloc wasopenly aidingUkraine in carrying out drone attacks against strategic aviation bases that host atomic weapons. Before Moscow can return to the table, Putin said, it must have a clear idea of NATO s nuclear arsenal including the UK and France, who are welcome to join the treaty. Come onboard, we do not mind. Just try not to lie to everyone this time and present yourselves as champions of peace and detente. We know the truth, the Russian president said. In August 2022, Moscowsuspendedthe New Start inspection regime, saying US sanctions had prevented Russian inspectors from doing their job, giving Washington an unfair advantage. Technical talks on resuming the inspections, scheduled for the end of November in Egypt, were postponed indefinitely. Russia said there wasno point in talkingto the US while Washington was sending billions of dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine. ",https://www.rt.com/news/571934-biden-newstart-nuclear-mistake/

"19 Feb, 2023",Chinese tourists change travel destinations,"A number of countries have imposed flight restrictions and entrance rules aimed exclusively at Beijing The gradual reopening of China s economy following the end of Covid-19 lockdowns has propelled tourism outside its borders, but lingering pandemic-induced problems have seen Chinese altering their travel preferences, CNBC reported this week, citing data from booking website Ctrip. According to the report, travel bookings by Chinese tourists going abroad surged by 640% during the Lunar New Year holidays compared with the same time last year, while overseas hotel bookings have quadrupled. Last year Chinese travelers singled out Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea as their top travel spots, but this year the majority of travelers went instead to Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Bali. The change is based partly on flight restrictions, visa issues and lingering pandemic-related entrance rules affecting Chinese passport holders. Chinese citizens were unable to obtain visas to South Korea and Japan after both countries stopped processing them over concerns about China s recent surge in Covid-19 infections. In Europe, vacationers from China have to wait an extended period of time to obtain visas due to high demand. Prior to the pandemic, EU visa applications took only several days to be processed, while now applicants have to wait up to two months to get a Schengen stamp, according to the SchengenVisaInfo.com website. Thailand is the top choice for Chinese group tours at the moment, according to Ctrip data, with Maldives and Egypt coming in as the second and third most popular choices. Group tours are now also allowed from China to Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Laos, as well as the UAE, South Africa, Hungary, Cuba and Russia. Meanwhile Japan, South Korea and Vietnam still prohibit group tours. China s borders were largely closed to tourist travel from 2019 due to the Covid pandemic. The reopening that kicked off in December last year saw the government scrapping mandatory quarantines for those visiting mainland China, restarting its visa-free policy and resuming group tour travel. Analysts expect Beijing s move to help restore Asia s pandemic-battered retail sector and hotel industry. ",https://www.rt.com/business/571462-chinese-tourists-travel-destinations/

In an address to the African Union (AU) summit, published on the Kremlin website on Saturday, Putin praised the AU as an authoritative international structure, playing a vital role in settling local conflicts, assuring stability, and strengthening ties between African nations. For Russia, African states have always been and remain important and reliable partners. We are united by the desire to build a just and multipolar world order, based on true equality and rule of international law, free from any form of discrimination, forceful dictatorship and sanctions pressure, the Russian leader told the gathering, now underway in Ethiopia s capital, Addis Ababa. Putin also reiterated his invitation to African leaders to attend the second Russia-Africa Summit, scheduled to take place in St Petersburg this July. The first such forum, held in Sochi in 2019, created good conditions for intensifying our traditionally friendly relations, both on the bilateral level and on a multilateral basis, he said. The event in St Petersburg should allow the sides to set new goals in expanding their cooperation further in various areas, the president added. I look forward to continued constructive joint work for the benefit of our countries and peoples, in the interests of ensuring peaceful and prosperous development of the African continent, Putin wrote. Relations between Russia and Africa have become closer during the conflict in Ukraine, as many nations on the continent have resisted Western pressure to condemn and sanction Moscow.

"17 Feb, 2023",Russia should ditch dollar in trade with African countries economist to RT,"Settlements in national currencies are key to boosting commerce, an African studies professor says Western sanctions have prompted Russia to develop stronger economic ties with African countries, and switching to national currencies instead of using the dollar and euro in mutual trade will further boost cooperation, the head of the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences said in an interview with RT. According to Irina Abramova, Russia-Africa ties gained momentum last year, after Western countries sanctioned Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. Around 30 large Russian companies are already working in Africa on different projects, including a nuclear power plant in Egypt. However, smaller companies and businesses are still cautious in dealing with the continent, having no assurance that they won t lose money due to the lack of legislation and trade tools that would support their projects. We need to be more proactive in amending our legislation, introducing new tools to ensure that our businesses can safely operate on the African continent, starting with the issue of payment systems, switching to payments in national currencies, but also clearing and barter trade, Abramova said. According to the academic, Russia needs to foster public-private partnership with African companies, with the government creating conditions for businesses to operate on the continent by absorbing some of the risks, reducing taxes and providing guarantees. We need a strong push to gain momentum and kick-start the whole thing. There was a push when our Western partners turned their backs on us and we started searching for new opportunities in terms of both exports and imports. I also think we gained an appreciation of who is our friend and who is our enemy. In this respect Africa is ready to help us, Abramova said.

"17 Feb, 2023",Top Russian academic explains rapprochement with Africa,"The conflict in Ukraine has revealed Moscow s true friends and foes, head of the Institute for African Studies says Many African countries have resisted pressure to condemn Moscow over the Ukraine conflict because they see that the West is now using the same methods of colonial oppression against Russia that their own continent had suffered from, Irina Abramova, director of the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has told RT. The conflict in Ukraine has given a new impetus to Russia s return to Africa. It tore away the disguises, revealing our true friends and foes, Abramova said in an interview on Friday. The African nations weren t afraid to speak up against the economic sanctions [on Moscow] and stood firm in the face of enormous pressure from the West. Despite certain inconsistencies during the voting on some of the UN s anti-Russian resolutions, their behavior was exemplary, she recalled. Last March, 26 African countries out of 54 refused to support a UN resolution condemning Russia, mostly abstaining or not submitting their votes. The number of nations from the continent who didn t back a similar document in October, had increased to 28. One of the reasons for that was that Africa sees that the same methods of colonial oppression once utilized against Africa are being used today against Russia, the academic explained. The Africans are also grateful [to Moscow] because they remember how the Soviet Union helped them achieve both political and economic sovereignty, Abramova said. The USSR built over 300 major industrial enterprises, more than 1,000 infrastructure facilities, and trained over 500,000 staff in Africa, she said. Russia reducing its activities on the continent in the 1990s was a big mistake and now we re starting to realize it, the academic pointed out. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has made two African tours in less than a year, visiting Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of the Congo in summer, and traveling to South Africa, Angola, Eswatini and Eritrea in January. Moscow has a lot to gain from restoring relations with Africa because the continent is a global leader in financial technology and decentralized finance, or a third of resources that the world s green economies and defense industries require are located in Africa, or that 60% of the continent s people are younger than 25 years of age, meaning that they are the future of the world, Abramova pointed out. Africa, for its part, is interested in boosting trade with Russia while dealing without middlemen, as well as getting access to Russian technologies that are essential to speed up its modernization, she said.

"14 Feb, 2023",Italian PM to testify in murder trial,"Giorgia Meloni will give evidence on Egypt s role in stalling the case of a murdered student Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani have been called to testify in the trial of four Egyptian law enforcement agents accused of torturing and murdering an Italian student in 2016. Meloni will be asked what assurances she received from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that Cairo will cooperate. Meloni and Tajani will testify in Rome on April 3, Italian media reported on Monday. Their testimony was requested by Alessandra Ballerini, a lawyer representing the family of the late Giulio Regeni. Regeni was a student at Cambridge University in 2016 when he traveled to Cairo to conduct research on trade unions and labor unrest. He disappeared that January, and his mutilated corpse was discovered in a ditch several days later, bruised, beaten, burned, and stabbed. Italian and Egyptian investigations concluded that he was tortured for several days before succumbing to his injuries. He was 28 years old. Cairo blamed the abduction and murder on a criminal gang, although Italian prosecutors backedby US officials pinned the blame on al-Sisi s security agents. Four security officials were charged and tried in absentia in Rome, with the case opening in October 2021. However, the case has not progressed since, as the Egyptian authorities have not released the addresses of the four accused. Under Italian law, the case could not begin unless the men were officially informed that they had been charged. Meloni met with al-Sisi at a UN climate summit in Egypt in November, telling reporters afterwards that the pair touched on the Regeni case. Tajani met with the Egyptian leader in January, and said that al-Sisi assured him that he would remove the obstacles to resolving the case. Ballerini said that she would ask Meloni and Tajani precisely what kind of assurances al-Sisi offered them. Regeni s murder soured relations between Rome and Cairo. Meloni s predecessors rekindled this relationship, however, with state gas company Eni signing a deal with its Egyptian counterpart on Prime Minister Mario Draghi s watch last year, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte inking a $1.2 billion arms deal with Egypt the year before.

Speaking at the Egypt Petroleum Show, Haitham Al-Ghais of Kuwait said climate policies need to be more balanced and fair. His comments follow a major shift among countries and energy corporations, on moving away from fossil fuels. It is imperative that all parties involved in the ongoing climate negotiations pause for a moment; look at the big picture, Al-Ghais said. He called for joint efforts towards an energy transition that is orderly, inclusive and helps ensure energy security for all. Global prices of oil, natural gas and coal soared last year following the Ukraine-related sanctions imposed by Western powers on Russia, one of the world s biggest producers and exporters of crude and petroleum products. In March 2022, the industry s main global benchmark Brent topped $133 per barrel, surging by over $50 from the start of that year, to reach its highest level since June 2008. Prices then eased, and ended the year at around the same level they started. However, on a yearly basis, oil is being traded 43% higher than in 2021. According to Al-Ghais, the global oil industry needs up to $500 billion of investment annually through 2045, as it has been plagued by several years of chronic underinvestment. The COP28 climate summit in late 2023, which will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC member, will serve as a fresh opportunity to explore inclusive, sustainable and consensus-based solutions to climate change, the secretary general said. The top official also said the group expects oil demand to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2023, reaching almost 102 million barrels a day, and to further increase to 110 million barrels per day by 2025.

Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . The US Biden administration has reportedly presented a plan to cool tensions between Palestinians and Israelis, which have dramatically escalated since the formation of Israel s new right-wing government. As reported byAxios, following up on a request made by US secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his visit to the Middle East late last month, his Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Barbara Leaf, stayed behind and worked on presenting a roadmap towards preventing a violent escalation in the region. Antony Blinken had urged both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to pause provocative steps in order to avoid further hostilities. The requests made by the Biden administration were originally geared towards the Palestinian Authority (PA) taking significant steps, whilst minimal requirements were put on the Netanyahu government. Antony Blinken urged Mahmoud Abbas to implement a security plan presented by US security coordinator Lt. Gen. Michael Fenzel, who proposed creating a special PA Security Force wing that would be trained by the US to fight Palestinian militias that have formed over the past two years in the Jenin and Nablus areas. Later on, the US also requested that Israel reduce the number of raids on Palestinian towns and refugee camps, in addition to halting their plans for significant settlement expansion; both of which Israel refuses to follow through on. In September of 2021, the Jenin Brigades armed group announced its formation out of the Jenin refugee camp, later growing and expanding its areas of operations to the wider Jenin area. The armed group does not have any traceable command-and-control structure. It consists primarily of men between the ages of 18 and 25, mostly formed of members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement and Fatah Party members who are no longer loyal to the ruling clique in the party that commands the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. Later, in September of 2022, the Lions Den armed movement also announced its formation in the old city of Nablus, claiming to belong to no political party. Due to the rise of newly formed armed groups, which hasn t happened in the West Bank since the early 2000s, the Palestinian Authority s security forces have lost control of much of the northern West Bank. The US proposal for the Palestinian Authority to form a special force to fight against the armed militias is an extremely dangerous intervention in the affairs of the region. It is reminiscent of the UK-backed peace bands formed under the British Mandate in the late 1930s, when the British took the initiative to use Palestinians to fight each other. However, unlike then, there is no support for anti-militia activities from the Palestinian public today. In fact, the overwhelming majority support the Jenin Brigades, Lions Den and other armed groups, according to all available polling data. The PA has been significantly weakened over the past three years due to a financial crisis, corruption, the lack of any diplomatic breakthroughs, the postponement of national elections, and the killing and detention of Palestinians for the sake of Israeli security. The Palestinian Authority has even been engaged in limited armed exchanges with the newly formed militias in the West Bank over the past year, triggering mass protests from angry West Bank residents. The number one issue that Palestinians in the West Bank have with the PA is its security coordination with Israel, which essentially means that the PA s security forces work with the Israeli military, intelligence and border police, in order to combat Palestinian threats against Israelis, but not the other way around. When Israel raided the Jenin refugee camp last month, killing 10 Palestinians, including three civilians, one of whom was an elderly woman, the PA announced the suspension of security coordination in response. The US assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs met last week with Israel s National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, and President Abbas senior advisor, Hussein al-Sheikh, to propose that the Palestinian Authority return to security coordination with Israel, in exchange for Israel slowing down settlement expansion. The US also sought for the PA to pause its attempts to take Israel before the International Court of Justice and the UN for alleged war crimes a move for which the PA has been punished with Israeli sanctions. Last Thursday, CIA director Bill Burnsexpressed his concernover the possibility of a third intifada [Palestinian uprising] erupting inside the West Bank, stating that a lot of what we re seeing today has a very unhappy resemblance to some of those realities that we saw then [during the Second Intifada] too . His concern is congruent with the reality on the ground, wherelast year was the deadliestfor West Bank Palestinians since the end of the Second Intifada in 2005, according to the United Nations. Palestinian attacks against Israeli settlers and soldiers are also a daily occurrence now. Despite the US government clearly identifying the nature of the escalation, it shows complete ignorance of its own role in creating the current hostilities. The bulk of the US secretary of state s visit to Palestine-Israel was tailored toforwarding Arab-Israeli normalization effortsand to expanding the Negev Forum , which Morocco, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt form with Israel, in order to advance their own ties. At the same time, Antony Blinken spoke of reaching a two-state solution between Palestinians and Israelis as being the only path to any lasting peace. Under the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 (also known as the Saudi Initiative), a two-state solution (meaning the recognition by Israel of a Palestinian state and the end of occupation of Palestinian territories) is a precondition for the normalization of ties between Israel and Arab states. By pushing for normalization without that precondition, Blinken effectively seeks to deprive the Palestinian Authority of its best bargaining chip and leaves it powerless to extract any concessions from the Israeli government, whose officials will not even consider sitting down for meetings with their Palestinian counterparts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already stated that he is not willing to halt settlement expansion, as proposed by the US government, with Israel s Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, openly announcing that there will beno freeze on settlement construction, which is considered illegal by the UN and most world powers. Israel has also announced its intention to increase raids and further military activities in the West Bank, in what it deems to be a preparation for likely hostilities during the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan. Despite the PA having announced the end of its security coordination with Israel, it is clear that some coordination is still occurring and that the announcement was more of a public relations move for President Abbas, who is feeling the pressure from a disgruntled Palestinian population. This in itself is a key indicator that the PA is feeling the pressure from Palestinian society at large and a sign that any US-trained PA force to combat the militia groups could lead to a disaster, whereby the Ramallah-based authority could even be overthrown due to the outrage such a step would cause. When the CIA worked to create the new PA security force during the latter years of the Second Intifada, it only worked after the PA itself had participated in the fight against the Israeli military and still maintained some degree of popular support. In addition to this, the Israeli army had conducted Operation Defensive Shield, which led to the assassinations or arrests of the most prominent militia leaders inside the West Bank. The only way the PA could possibly regain control of Jenin and Nablus is by proving to the Palestinian people that it is on their side, and not fighting for the US and Israel. It is also the reality that many of the leading fighters in the militia groups, especially in Jenin, are actually members of the PA s security forces that have gone rogue. Armed militias also seem to be forming in areas like Bethlehem, al-Khalil and even Jericho, which proves that the re-emergence of the armed struggle in the West Bank is not only limited to the north of the territory. The only way to properly combat the escalation and to stop this from growing into a much larger confrontation, is to provide hope for the Palestinian people inside the West Bank, something that the US will not even consider. Instead of the US working as an objective mediator, it works solely for Israel s immediate interests and accepts the political restraints of each Israeli government as an excuse for repeatedly violating its own red lines. The US considers every single Palestinian political party as a terrorist organization, other than the mainstream branch of the Fatah Party, meaning that they will not even talk to any Palestinian representatives other than those that adhere to their own demands. The obsessive pursuit of Saudi Arabia normalizing ties with Israel, seemingly for political gain on behalf of the Biden administration, also contributes to robbing Palestinians of any hope for peace. The situation inside the West Bank cannot be resolved using bombs and bullets. Even if every single member of all the armed groups were to be killed, the same problem would again emerge for Israel in the future. Despite this, Washington will never look critically at what is going on and realize that there are two sides to this conflict. At this time the US government is dealing with the escalation as if Israel has a termite problem and not that there are people who are rising up in an ongoing struggle for statehood.",https://www.rt.com/news/571334-us-israel-palestine-peace/

"6 Feb, 2023",Global impact of massive Turkiye earthquake revealed,"The quake was felt in Greenland and triggered a tsunami warning in Italy, while causing shaking in Egypt, Israel and Lebanon The earthquake that caused widespread devastation in Turkiye and Syria on Monday was felt as far away as Greenland, a Danish seismologist said. The quake, which was followed hours later by a second tremor, was the most powerful to hit Turkiye this century. ""The large earthquakes in Turkiye were clearly registered on the seismographs in Denmark and Greenland,""Tine Larsen, a seismologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told France s AFP news agency. Seismic waves from the first quake reached the Danish island of Bornholm approximately five minutes after the shaking started, Larsen said, adding that the waves then reached the east coast of Greenland three minutes later. Greenland is more than 5,700 kilometers from the Turkish city of Gaziantep, close to the epicenter of the first quake. The 7.8 magnitude tremor struck shortly after 4am local time, destroying thousands of buildings as their occupants slept inside. At least 912 people were killed and more than 5,300 wounded, according to preliminary figures announced by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday morning. More than 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in neighboring Syria, according to government figures. The quake was followed by a magnitude 7.5 tremor in the early afternoon, which authorities said was not an aftershock. The first quake triggered a tsunami warning in Italy, as authorities worried that it could send enormous waves across the Mediterranean Sea toward Italy s Adriatic coast. However, the warning was lifted several hours later. Its effects were felt in Israel and Lebanon, with residents of Tel Aviv being jostled awake, according to the Times of Israel. Residents of Cairo in Egypt located nearly 1,000 kilometers from Gaziantep also felt the quake, the Associated Press reported. No casualties were reported in any of these countries. Erdogan said that the earthquake is Turkiye s biggest disaster since a 7.8 magnitude quake that killed more than 30,000 people in 1939.

"4 Feb, 2023",US officials pressing Africans over Wagner Group media,"The CIA and State Department have reportedly tried to pressure governments into kicking out the contractors The Biden administration has attempted to pressure African nations into expelling the Wagner private military company, with the firm s presence in Sudan and Libya at the top of every meeting between American and Egyptian officials, the Associated Press reported. CIA Director William Burns focused on the group during recent trips to Egypt and Libya, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed Wagner with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi during a jaunt to Cairo last month, the news agency reported on Saturday. Wagner obsesses [the American officials], said an Egyptian senior government official. It is at the top of every meeting. Egypt is a key conduit for American policy, with the Biden administration going as far as using Cairo topass messagesto Moscow, rather than communicating through direct channels. According to the report, the Egyptians reached out to their Sudanese and Libyan counterparts to relay Washington s displeasure with Wagner. Abbas Kamel, the director of Egypt s Intelligence Directorate Agency, urged the head of Sudan s ruling sovereign council, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan to address Wagner s use of Sudan as a base for operations in Central Africa, a Sudanese official said. Burns himself visited Libya to speak to the country s competing governments, discussing Wagner with Libyan National Army (LNA) commander Khalifa Haftar, the report claimed. Egypt reportedly asked that Haftar not station Wagner soldiers near its borders, while the US demanded that Wagner fighters be removed from their posts safeguarding Libyan oil facilities. Founded in 2014, Wagner has mainly operated as a security contractor in Africa and the Middle East. The precise details of its deployments are not made public, although Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin has confirmed that his forces fought in Libya. He denied involvement in Sudan when asked by American journalists last year, saying at the time that he was not aware of any evidence that the Wagner Group exists, and that he had personally donated humanitarian aid to the conflict-stricken country. Who arranged wars and revolutions in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Mozambique, Central Africa, and so on? he told RT last month. Some of these countries later turned to the Wagner PMC, which put an end to these wars with an iron fist. The US declared the Wagner Group a transnational criminal organization last month, after Wagner forces notched up a series of victories against the Ukrainian military in Donbass. Despite Washington s apparent obsession with the group, there is no evidence yet that the Biden administration s pressure has yielded results in either Sudan or Libya, the AP report noted.

"3 Feb, 2023",Central bank gold buying soars to 55-year high,"Overall demand in 2022 was the highest in over a decade, the World Gold Council has said Gold purchases soared by 18% in 2022 against the previous year with demand hitting nearly five metric tons, the most since 2011, the World Gold Council (WGC)saidon Tuesday. The uptrend comes on the heels of significant declines during the Covid-19 pandemic. The WGC also said that global central banks increased gold buying in the second half of the year, adding a staggering 1,136 tons of the metal worth some $70 billion to their stockpiles, up from only 450 tons the year before. This took annual buying in the sector to the highest volume since 1967. According to WGC senior analyst Krishan Gopaul, much of the central banks purchases were spurred by the fact that bullion is seen as a more secure asset in turbulent times, expected to hold its value despite geopolitical changes, unlike the more volatile fiat currencies and bonds. In our central bank survey, what we were told as reasons to hold gold was its performance in times of crisis, that it's an effective diversifier and there's no counterparty risk. If you look at last year, both the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, you'll see that all of those factors as well as being a reason to own gold could be seen as reasons to buy more gold, he noted. Most central bank buying came from emerging markets, including China, Turkiye and Egypt, which traditionally hold lower bullion volumes than Western banks, Gopaul said. However, for Western central banks, who haven't been buying, because they already own a lot of gold, the key point is they're actually not selling, he added. The WGS also noted that nearly two-thirds of the gold bought by central banks last year was not reported publicly. ",https://www.rt.com/business/570742-central-bank-gold-buying-soars/
"1 Feb, 2023",Russian ambassador comments on normal US diplomacy,"Anatoly Antonov wondered why the State Department chose secret messages via Egypt instead of picking up the phone Anatoly Antonov, Moscow s ambassador to Washington, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was baffled that the US chose to pass a message to Russia via Egypt, instead of using the normal and available diplomatic channels. Appearing on the Channel One news show Great Game on Wednesday evening, Antonov was asked about the message US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asked his Egyptian colleague Sameh Shoukry to pass on to Moscow. The US considers it normal for Blinken to send some kind of messages to Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov via Shoukry or some other messenger, Antonov told the show. What, he can t pick up the phone and call our minister to discuss serious matters? Lavrov said on Tuesday that Moscow has always been willing to listen to a serious proposal from Washington when it came to the conflict in Ukraine. What Shoukry passed along from Blinken was nothing of the sort, the Russian foreign minister said. Americans, Antonov told Channel One, are not inclined to resolve the situation in the Ukrainian territory by diplomatic means. Instead, Washington keeps stuffing the Ukrainian military with weapons and keeping the conflict in a state of controlled heat. The Russian ambassador predicted the US will continue to increase weapons deliveries to Kiev, while steadily testing the reaction of the public at home. However, he said, Washington is well aware that Western weapons and cannon fodder in the form of Ukrainian military personnel are not enough to achieve victory. According to Antonov, the conflict in Ukraine is just part of a broader struggle for a new, multipolar world order, whose outlines can already be seen. The ambassador also noted that contacts between the US and Russia have been reduced to space exploration and maintaining the New START nuclear arms control treaty. Last August, when he called the ruined relationship crumbs of what used to exist,Antonov mentioneda deconfliction hotline in Syria as well notably missing from Wednesday s interview. Meanwhile, the State Department hasaccusedRussia of violating the New Start with its refusal to facilitate inspection activities. Moscow suspended inspections last summer, citing the inability of Russian inspectors to do their job on account of US sanctions. While Russia values the treaty, further discussions within its scope are impossible so long as the US keeps sending weapons to Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministrysaidin November.

"31 Jan, 2023",US accuses Russia of violating nuclear treaty media,"Washington has reportedly claimed that Moscow breached terms of the New START accord by blocking on-site weapons inspections US President Joe Biden s administration has reportedly accused Russia of violating the last remaining nuclear weapons treaty between the two countries by blocking on-site inspections. The US State Department made the allegation marking the first US claim that Moscow breached terms of the New START treaty in a report sent to Congress on Tuesday, theWall Street Journalreported. The report also claimed that Russian officials had rejected US requests to hold a meeting to address compliance concerns. Russia s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control, the State Department said in a statement to Reuters. The conflict may add to concerns that the world s two largest nuclear superpowers may no longer be able to work together on nonproliferation goals amid deteriorating relations between Washington and Moscow. The Kremlin said earlier this month that US-Russian relations were probably at an all-time low and offered no hope of improving as Washington intervened against Moscow in the Ukraine crisis. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists warned last week that a nuclear arms race will ensue if the New START is allowed to expire in 2026, as scheduled, without being replaced. New START, which then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev signed in 2010, replaced the Treaty of Moscow and called for reducing the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers globally by half. Russia has a clear path for resuming compliance with the treaty, and the US stands ready to collaborate with Moscow on fully implementing the deal, the State Department said. In November, the Kremlin canceled New START talks that had been scheduled to take place in Cairo. Russia s Foreign Ministry said there was no possibility of resuming negotiations while the US was continuing to arm Ukraine. The US intends to supply even more weapons to the conflict region, in which the Russian Federation is directly involved, Foreign Ministry spokeswomanMaria Zakharovasaid at the time. That is, they will supply all these weapons, they will encourage the Kiev regime to cause even more bloodshed, they will allocate money for extremist activities that are carried out under the auspices of these delusional people. And we will sit with them at the same table and discuss issues of mutual security with them, including those in their interest?""

"31 Jan, 2023",Lavrov reveals message from Blinken,"The information contained no serious proposals, the Russian foreign minister said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has conveyed a fresh message to Moscow on the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, although the statement offered nothing of value, according to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Russia s top diplomat made the remarks on Tuesday following talks with his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry. While Moscow has been always ready to hear a serious proposal from Washington aimed at resolving the current situation, the message from Blinken contained no such information, Lavrov stated. Minister [Shoukry] said that he conveyed a certain message from Secretary of State Blinken, who was recently on a visit to Cairo. I can confirm that, Lavrov said. The Russian diplomat added that the message once again urged Moscow to stop and leave, and then everything will be fine. The real goals of the US and the collective West, however, have been articulated much more clearly by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Lavrov continued. In one of his speeches, he said that Russia must lose, Russia must be defeated, and the West cannot allow Ukraine to lose, because then the West will lose. And the whole world will lose, Lavrov explained, referring to the NATO chief s comments. That is, he took it upon himself to speak not only on behalf of three-dozen NATO members, but also on behalf of all other countries of the world, [including] Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Multiple senior US officials have repeatedly urged Moscow to end its military campaign in Ukraine, as well as to cede the former Ukrainian territories which were incorporated into Russia following referendums. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland signaled last week that doing so might prompt Washington to consider easing anti-Russian sanctions. The proposal, however, was dismissed in Moscow. We still don t see anything [new] in Madame Nuland s words. We are absolutely not inclined to exaggerate their importance, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at the time, adding that the remarks once again showed the lack of flexibility in the position of the US. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, citing Kiev s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, which were designed to give Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev s main goal was to use the agreement to buy time and create powerful armed forces. The idea was confirmed by then-Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and then-President of France Francois Hollande. ",https://www.rt.com/news/570754-lavrov-gets-blinken-message/
"30 Jan, 2023",Moscow provides more evidence of US biolabs in Ukraine,"Kiev s troops were among the test subjects for Pentagon-funded research, the Russian MOD says Russia s Defense Ministry on Monday laid out more evidence that US-funded laboratories were working in Ukraine. Documents and materials recovered by Russian troops showed that Western pharmaceutical companies operating in territory under Kiev s control conducted HIV/AIDS research on Ukrainian military personnel. The commander of Russia s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, presented Ukrainian-language documents referring to HIV infection studies that began in 2019. The list of targeted groups shows service members alongside prisoners, drug addicts and other patients at high risk of infection. According to Kirillov, the Russian military has recovered more than 20,000 documents and other materials related to the biological programs in Ukraine, while interviewing eyewitnesses and participants. The evidence confirms the focus of the Pentagon on creating biological weapons components and testing them on the population of Ukraine and other states along [Russia s] borders, the general told reporters. Based on documents originating with the Pentagon s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Russian military identified eight more individuals involved in the US-funded research in Ukraine. Among the names Kirillov singled out was Karen Saylors of Labyrinth Global Health, previously of Metabiota, a companylinkedto US President Joe Biden s son Hunter. The latest trove of documents, belonging to the company Pharmbiotest, was unearthed in Lisichansk in the Lugansk People s Republic (LPR) early in January, Kirillov noted. Clinical samples and patient records with their personal data were buried, and not cremated or destroyed in a proper fashion. This suggests that the destruction of this evidence was carried out in extreme haste, the lieutenant general said. In October 2022, Russia filed an official complaint over alleged US-backed biological activities in Ukraine and requested a UN probe into the matter. The UN Security Council rejected Moscow s proposal after the US, UK, and France voted against it. The US opposition once again confirms that Washington has something to hide, and that ensuring the transparency of biological research is contrary to US interests, Kirillov said. As evidence of the widespread threat posed by the Pentagon s biological research conducted beyond America s borders, Kirillov referred to the previously mentioned USinvolvementin coronavirus studies, including by funding the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance that contracted with the laboratory in Wuhan, China. Kirillov also brought up the 1977 outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Egypt, near a biological laboratory run by the US Navy. The disease previously known only south of the Sahara made a surprise appearance in Cairo a few months after the lab employees were vaccinated against it, the general said. Moreover, the Cairo strain was highly pathogenic compared to the disease s normal flu-like symptoms, suggesting the involvement of gain-of-function experiments.

"28 Jan, 2023",EU threatens migrants home countries,"Nations have been warned to take back their citizens or face restrictions on visa issuance Countries that refuse to accept their nationals back after they are turned away from the EU will face visa restrictions, the bloc s interior ministers warned this week. They urged the European Commission to take action as illegal immigration to the EU reached its highest level since 2016. Support for restricting the number of visas granted to non-cooperative nations is strong among EU member states, Swedish Minister for Migration Maria Malmer Stenergard claimed after a meeting of interior ministers on Thursday. We see irregular arrivals increasing Returning those who are denied asylum to Europe is a very important issue, Stenergard said. The current level [of returned migrants] is not acceptable. Just 21% of the 340,000 illegal immigrants refused asylum in 2021 were returned to their countries of origin, according to Eurostat data referenced in the meeting. If the political and diplomatic efforts [to improve cooperation with third countries] do not produce the expected results, the Member States call on the Commission to come back with proposals on visa restrictions, the Swedish minister continued. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed that there is a need to intensify the return of illegal migrants, calling for a pilot project that would bounce failed asylum seekers back from the bloc s external borders with immediate returns. The EU should agree on a list of safe countries where returns are unlikely to put migrants at risk, von der Leyen suggested, also recommending agreements with nations including Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Nigeria in order to prevent departures in the first place and improve returns where necessary. While the EU previously agreed to restrict visas to countries they considered uncooperative on accepting returned nationals, the only country thus punished so far has been Gambia, whose citizens can no longer obtain multiple-entry visas to the EU and must wait longer for those papers. The European Commission has proposed similar penalties for Iraq, Senegal, and Bangladesh, but disagreements among member countries have so far prevented agreement on whether or how to punish anyone else, according to Reuters. EU countries recorded over 330,000 illegal entry attempts last year, border control agency Frontex reported the most since 2016, and a figure that does not include legal asylum applicants or Ukrainian refugees. More than 80% of these were adult men. ",https://www.rt.com/news/570622-eu-migrants-visa-restriction/

Moscow's top diplomat shared a story from his visit to Egypt last July to speak before the Arab League. The US and its allies unsuccessfully attempted to prevent his appearance, or stage a concerted condemnation of Russia by member states over the conflict in Ukraine, Lavrov claimed, citing Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary general of the organization. When the lobbying effort failed, Western nations asked Arab delegates to at least not to take pictures with Lavrov and I am not joking, he said. For the record, after my speech, which took over an hour, each of the envoys asked me to pose for a picture, Lavrov concluded. The Russian minister, who shared the story during a press conference on Wednesday, said in his opinion the Western no photo op request was humiliating for the nations that delivered it. He praised the members of the Arab League for defying the call, saying such an act would have required a lot of political courage, if some other nations, including in Europe, were to take it. The administration of US President Joe Biden sought to isolate Russia diplomatically at international events. His staff reportedly planned carefully to avoid a possible intersection of Biden with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a summit of G20 leaders in Indonesia last year. The work seems to have been wasted, since Putin chose not to go and sent Lavrov to represent Russia instead. ",https://www.rt.com/news/570077-lavrov-arab-league-photos/
"17 Jan, 2023",Offshore gas deposit discovered in Egypt,"Italy s Eni plans to develop the field with US major Chevron Italian energy major Eni has announced the discovery of a new offshore gas deposit in Egypt at the Nargis-1 exploration well, which is located in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea s Nargis offshore area concession, the company said on Sunday. The Nargis-1 well is part of Egypt s 1,800-square-kilometer Nargis offshore area concession operated by the US oil and gas giant Chevron. Both companies own a 45% stake in the exploration project, while a 10% stake belongs to Egypt s Tharwa Petroleum Company SAE. The volume of reserves in the well are being evaluated, Egypt s state-owned EGAS said, adding that it would work with Chevron and the other partners to start production as soon as possible. Eni has been present in Egypt since 1954, where it operates through the subsidiary IEOC. The company is currently the country s leading supplier, with hydrocarbon production reaching approximately 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The new discovery at the Nargis-1 can be developed leveraging the proximity to Eni s existing facilities, the group said in a statement. The state-controlled company is looking for new gas sources as it aims to completely replace imports from Russia by 2025. Egypt has around 2.21 trillion cubic meters of proven gas reserves and produced over 95 billion cubic meters in 2021. The country strengthened its positions as a gas producer after Eni discovered the giant Zohr field in the Eastern Mediterranean in 2015 with an estimated 850 billion cubic meters of natural gas. In the past eight years, the African country has boosted its gas production by 66%. In 2022, Egypt exported about 22 million cubic meters of liquefied natural gas, the bulk of which went to Europe. Last year, the EU signed an agreement with Egypt and Israel to boost energy imports from the Eastern Mediterranean in order to cut dependence on Russia, and allow more Western companies to be involved in gas exploration in the region.

"16 Jan, 2023",China urges Israel to avoid provocations,"Beijing s new foreign minister says Chinese leaders are deeply worried about rising tensions between Israelis and Palestinians China s new foreign minister, Qin Gang, has wrapped up his first overseas trip by calling for Israel to avoid further provocations that could escalate heightened tensions with Palestinians. Israel should stop all incitement and provocation and avoid any unilateral actions that might lead to aggravation of the situation, Qin said at apress briefingon Sunday in Cairo, where he met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry at the end of a five-nation Africa tour. He added that China is deeply worried about deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian relations. Qin made his comments at a time when Israel s newly elected government is punishing the occupied territories for seeking a legal ruling from the UN s International Court of Justice on their plight. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s government reportedly banned public displays of Palestinian flags, revoked the travel pass of the Palestinian foreign minister and announced that it would withhold funds that would normally be transferred to the Palestinian Authority. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also stirred outrage by visiting the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Qin, who was promoted last month from his role as Beijing s ambassador to the US, called for maintaining the status quo at the Temple Mount, which includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam s third-most holy shrine. China has advocated a two-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestine. The international community should increase its sense of urgency, put the Palestine issue at the top of the international agenda, and promote the resumption of peace talks between Israel and Palestine, Qin said. The Chinese envoy also had meetings on Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. Qin said leaders in the region have agreed to work with Chinese officials to implement the Riyadh Declaration, which was issued at the end of the Arab-China Summit last month in Saudi Arabia. The declaration affirms a multilateral international order and rejects politicization of human rights issues and their use as a tool to interfere in internal affairs of other countries, he added. For decades, Chinese FMs have traditionally toured Africa shortly after being appointed. Beijing has undertaken massive infrastructure projects across the continent, running up $160 billion in loans to African countries.

"11 Jan, 2023",China warns West on Africa,"Beijing insists the continent should be a stage for international cooperation, not great power rivalry Promoting Beijing s investment in African development and modernization during his first foreign trip, China s new foreign minister Qin Gang said on Wednesday that the continent should not become a battleground for rival world powers. Qin began a five-country tour in Ethiopia on Wednesday, opening the new headquarters of the African Center for Disease Control (CDC), built by Chinese engineers. While in Addis Ababa, he met with the Ethiopian leadership and visited the African Union headquarters. He is scheduled to visit Egypt, Angola, Benin, and Gabon before returning to China. Africa should be a big stage for international cooperation, not an arena for competition between major countries, Qin said at a press conference with AU Commission chair Moussa Faki. A former Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin became foreign minister last month. He continued the tradition making Africa the first foreign destination of his tenure, which he noted has continued for 33 years without interruption. Speaking at the opening of the Africa CDC, he outlined Beijing s vision for relations with Africa, saying the two will always have a shared future no matter how the international environment changes. Today, our world, our times and history are changing in ways like never before. The collective rise of developing countries is irreversible, Qin said, adding that China and Africa should oppose hegemony, bullying, highhandedness and racial discrimination, and jointly safeguard true multilateralism and promote greater democracy in international relations. Qin insisted that Beijing s policy was based on the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. China makes no empty promises, still less presses others against their own will, he said in the speech at the Africa CDC.

The US and its European allies many of whom used to be colonial powers in Africa have long accused China of practicing debt trap diplomacy.

The company recently started exporting automobiles to China and the United Arab Emirates. When asked about the possibility of exporting cars made by another Russian carmaker, Moskvich, the deputy PM said the issue would be studied. This approach is largely true not just for Moskvich, but for other carmakers as well.

We all know that the slots are booked until 2032. But 2036 onwards, we have hopes and I am sure India will fully prepare a bid for the Olympics, Thakur toldthe Times of Indiain an interview on Tuesday. The likely host city would be Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat, and the government would throw its full support behind a bid by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), Thakur added. India has previously hosted the Asian Games in 1982 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010 but the Olympics would be the biggest global sporting spectacle to make its way to a nation with a population of around 1.4 billion people. India is ready to positively bid for it I can assure you that we will not only host the Olympics, we will host it in a big way, Thakur said. If India is making news in every sector from manufacturing to services, then why not sports? India is looking very seriously at bidding for the 2036 Olympics. In addition to India, numerous other nations have expressed potential interest in welcoming the 2036 Games.

"26 Dec, 2022",Scientists reconstruct handsome face of Ramses II,"Researchers used CT software to digitally unwrap the mummy of one of ancient Egypt's greatest pharaohs Egyptian and British scientists have unveiled a facial reconstruction of Ramses II, having used computer tomography (CT) software to digitally unwrap the mummy of the famous Ancient Egyptian pharaoh. The joint scientific project allowed historians for the first time to observe what the ruler looked like at different points in his life. The researchers say they used earlier CT scans of the pharaoh s mummy and applied them to analysis software. They were then able to differentiate between the skull and other materials used during the embalming process and produce a 3D rendering of the skull. They then applied the average facial muscle layer measurements believed to be appropriate for ancient Egyptians to reconstruct the pharaoh s face. ""This is the only scientific facial reconstruction of Ramesses II based on the CT scan of his actual mummy, explained professor Sahar Saleem of Cairo University, who led the project, adding that previous attempts were mostly artistic, based on his mummy s face. The initial rendering showed researchers what Ramses II looked like at the time of his death at the age of 90. Imaging experts then used that image to reverse the aging process and reveal what the pharaoh was like at the younger age of 45. ""I find the reconstructed face is a very handsome Egyptian person with facial features characteristic of Ramesses II the pronounced nose, and strong jaw,""said Saleem, in a statement cited by the Daily Mail. King Ramesses II was a great warrior who ruled Egypt for 66 years, she noted, adding that bringing Ramesses face to life in his old age and as a young man reminds the world of his legendary status. Ramses II, also referred to as Ramses the Great, was the third pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt and is believed to have ruled the country from 1279 BC until his death in 1213 BC. He is considered one of the most celebrated and powerful pharaohs of the New Kingdom the most powerful period of the Egyptian empire. Some also associate Ramses II with the figure who was in power during the biblical Book of Exodus, which tells the story of the Israelites escaping from Egypt under the leadership of Moses.

The North African country applied to join the group, which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, in November. Tebboune made the prediction while talking to national media on Thursday about his government s plans for economic development. Alegeria will boost investments, improve human development and shift towards a more advanced export structure relying less on hydrocarbons, to qualify for BRICS membership, he said. Algeria is a major producer of natural gas and the biggest exporter of the fuel in the region. Partnering with BRICS would help Algeria launch ambitious joint infrastructure projects, such as a transnational railroad that would improve the nation s connection to the Sahel region, Tebboune said. BRICS was originally BRIC , a term coined by economists to describe four nations with the potential to dominate the world economy in the 21st century. The said nations formed a group in the late 2000s and soon welcomed South Africa as a new member, adding S to the abbreviation. Algeria formally applied to join it in November, months after Iran and Argentina did the same during the annual summit of the organization hosted by China in June.

North Carolina Republican Dan Bishop condemned the bill s egregious provisions. Unveiled by Senate leaders late on Monday night, the $1.7 trillion package would fund the federal government through September 2023. With a vote due on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have called for bipartisan unity in passing it, with both citing the provision of more economic and military aid to Ukraine as a vital priority. In the House of Representatives, however, Republicans havethreatenedto obstruct the policy priorities of any Republican senator who backs the legislation, once the GOP retakes control of the lower chamber in January. The mammoth proposal increases funding for 19 government departments, according toanalysisfrom the American Action Forum. The Pentagon is set to be the biggest beneficiary of congressional largesse, receiving a $69 billion funding boost to bring its 2023 budget to a record $797 billion. Poring through the bill, Rep. Dan Bishop noticed some particularly bizarre provisions. While US Customs and Border Protection will be allowed to acquire drones and other new technology and capabilities, it cannot use these tools to acquire, maintain, or extend border security. It expressly prohibits CBP funding from being used to improve border security.pic.twitter.com/g2F4o1zl2D However, the bill allocates $410 million toward securing the borders of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman. Other foreign spending includes funding for an online-only University of Afghanistan, $23 million for democracy programs in Bangladesh, and an unspecified bounty for gender programs in Pakistan. Back in the US, the bill sets aside more than half a billion dollars for asubdivisionof the National Institutes of Health focused on structural racism, $335 million to prepare vaccines and surveillance tools for a future influenza pandemic, and more than $575 million to promote family planning in areas where biodiversity is threatened by population growth. On a more sinister note, here's at least $575 million for ""family planning"" in areas where population growth ""threatens biodiversity.""

Additionally, Washington DC will get a Ukrainian Independence Park and monuments to journalists, Georgia will get a $3.6 million Michelle Obama Trail, and outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will get a federal building in San Francisco named in her honor.

"29 Nov, 2022",US approves $1 billion arms sale to Qatar,"The Biden administration announced its decision on a key weapons deal with Doha during the US-Iran World Cup match US President Joe Biden s administration has approved a long-delayed weapons deal with Qatar, agreeing to supply its Middle East ally with $1 billion worth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The US State Department announced its go-ahead for the deal on Tuesday, just as the American and Iranian teams were starting the second half of their World Cup soccer match in Doha. The sale includes 10 advanced drone systems, 200 drone interceptors and related equipment. Qatar made its request for a UAV purchase, including MQ-9 reaper drones, in 2020. Despite Doha s close ties with Washington, including hosting the US Central Command s forward headquarters and the Pentagon s air operations center for the region at Al Udeid Air Base, US officials were slow to approve the deal. Even as Qatar hosted thousands of refugees and helped ease the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani s government struggled to get clear answers from the Biden administration on what was holding up the UAV transaction. The Pentagon encouraged approval of the sale, citing Qatar s reliability as a trusted partner, but State Department officials were concerned that other countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, would be angered, according tomedia reportslast year. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut off relations with Qatar in 2017, accusing the country of supporting terrorists. The US had a falling-out with Saudi Arabia this year, after Riyadh allegedly reneged on asecret dealto boost oil supplies ahead of this month s midterm congressional elections. Biden responded by pledging to re-evaluate the US-Saudi relationship, saying, there will be consequences. The UAV sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East, the State Department said in a statement. It will improve Qatar s capability to meet current and future threats by providing electronic and kinetic defeat capabilities against unmanned aircraft systems. The US-supplied drones will help Qatar monitor its vast natural-gas infrastructure and prevent terrorist attacks.

According to the figures, this made New Delhi the largest buyer of Urals oil this month. India has been boosting imports of Russian oil for several months. In October, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia and Iraq to become the South Asian country s largest oil supplier with a 22% share in India s total crude imports, according to data from the energy cargo tracker Vortexa. Prior to this year, European countries used to be the largest buyers of Russia s Urals grade oil. Those exports dropped amid Western sanctions on Moscow, with European countries accounting for less than 25% of the shipments this month. Nearly all of them went to refineries in which Russian energy firms have a stake. Traders expect the volume of Urals exports to the EU to drop further in December when a proposed price cap on Russian oil comes into force. Overall, 7.5 million tons of Urals grade oil left Russian ports this month, apart from Kazakhstan s transit volumes. Roughly 15% of those exports went to Turkey, which remained the biggest buyer of Urals oil in the Mediterranean.

He made the comment a week after Turkiye began conducting airstrikes on Kurdish-linked sites in northern Syria and Iraq. Just as Turkiye-Egypt relations started to normalize, in the next period it can also happen with Syria, Erdogan said at a meeting in the city of Konya, broadcast by news channel TRT. There is no room for hard feelings in politics. Turkish officials blamed the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Syrian-based Kurdish-led People s Defense Units (YPG) for a deadly bombing in Istanbul, Turkiye s most populous city. The November 13 attack claimed the lives of 6 people. The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkiye, the US, and EU, denied any involvement in the Istanbul blast. Erdogan, however, warned on Wednesday that Ankara could launch a ground military operation against Kurdish forces in Syria. Relations between Ankara and Damascus have deteriorated significantly over the years due to Turkiye s support of the anti-government Syrian National Army, previously known as the Free Syrian Army. Syria has also accused Turkiye of occupying parts of its territory, as Turkish troops have made several incursions to fight Kurdish forces in the past and have clashed with Syrian government troops. Ties between Ankara and Cairo worsened in 2013 when Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the country s top military commander at the time, ousted his predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, from power. The countries have since refrained from appointing ambassadors to each other s capitals. Erdogan, however, described meeting el-Sisi on the sidelines of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar this month as a step towards mending ties.

He added, however, that diplomats from both nations maintain contact via established channels. There have been no plans for such a contact, and we are not planning any high-level contacts at the moment, Ryabkov said during a briefing. He said communication between Moscow and Washington is carried out through telephone conversations involving relevant senior officials, but not at presidential level. We are having dialogue through the usual diplomatic channels, he explained. Ryabkov s comments echo remarks last week by Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov, who said a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Joe Biden is not being discussed at present. Last month, however, Peskov indicated that the two leaders could meet if the US were willing to address Moscow s security concerns. The spokesman referred particularly to draft documents on security guarantees that Moscow submitted to both Brussels and Washington before the Ukraine conflict broke out in late February. At the time, Moscow demanded that the West ban Ukraine from entering NATO, and insisted that the alliance retreat to its 1997 borders. The initiative, however, was rebuffed. While Russia has repeatedly stated that it is not holding any talks with the US over Ukraine, the two powers are negotiating over several other issues.

The diplomat also said Moscow and Washington were scheduled to discuss the landmark New Start agreement, which places limits on the two powers nuclear arsenals. Consultations on the matter are supposed to take place in Cairo, Egypt from November 29 to December 6.

Bundeswehr soldiers have been deployed in the African country for almost a decade, as part of the UN peacekeeping operation MINUSMA, something the government in Bamako has been increasingly unhappy about. Chancellor Olaf Scholz s government will ask the Bundestag to give the deployment one last year-long extension in May 2023, in order to bring this mission to a structured end after ten years, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Tuesday. The UN has not yet received Germany s official notice that it intends to withdraw, however, and intends to continue the mission in Mali. The mission is currently assessing the impact of these withdrawals on its operations and we are already in discussions with a number of countries in order to fill any gaps, said deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. Egypt has already pulled out of MINUSMA. Sweden said its forces would leave by June 2023, while the UK and Ivory Coast announced last week that their soldiers would be leaving soon as well. Germany s scouts are mostly deployed near Gao, in the northern desert, and amount to less than a tenth out of MINUSMA s total strength of 15,000. Another 20 or so soldiers serve with UN missions in South Sudan and Western Sahara, which have not been discontinued yet. Mali invited outside help in 2013, after militants pledging allegiance to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) seized large portions of the country. Its former colonial overlord France led the way, launching Operation Barkhane that expanded to neighboring Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania, and Niger. Paris officially ended the missionearlier this month, however, amid growing discontent from former colonies. Mali hadcanceledits defense pact with France in May. Bamako hasaccused Franceof actually helping terrorists and reportedly sought help from the Russian private military company, Wagner. Berlin s decision to withdraw meant that Scholz and Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht had prevailed over Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who publicly opposed the idea.

"21 Nov, 2022",Can Disney s new boss fix its real problem?,"Robert Bridgeis an American writer and journalist. He is the author of 'Midnight in the American Empire,' How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream. Robert Bridgeis an American writer and journalist. He is the author of 'Midnight in the American Empire,' How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream. America s most powerful entertainment company has made the shocking move of bringing back Bob Iger as its CEO after less than a year in retirement. The outgoing boss, Bob Chapek, has reportedly done""irreparable damage""to his own""ability to lead,""presiding over a period of massive financial loss suffered by Disney. It is expected that Iger, who had run the company for 15 years before handing the reins over to Chapek, will be able to reverse Disney s downturn, brought on both by objective factors like the Covid-19 pandemic and Chapek s bad management. But will he address what many see as the main issue that alienates many theater-goers, and by extension, profits the liberal gender ideology increasingly being pushed both on- and off-screen by some Disney employees? Once upon a time in America, back in the relatively innocent 1970s, it was a tradition for many families to gather around the television set on Sunday nights and watch the latest high-quality Disney film. And while it may be hard to imagine in these times of activism, the only agenda of America s most powerful entertainment company was to tell a good, wholesome story. Those days of innocence are gone, probably forever. Like so many other corporations today, Disney could not resist jumping on the woke bandwagon, and now finds itself in the vanguard of progressive activism. In the summer release of Lightyear , for example, one of the selling points pushed by executives at Disney-Pixar was that the film would include the company s first same-sex kiss, as though that revelation would pack parents and children into the theaters. Plot spoiler: It didn t. The inclusion of LGBTQ+ content precluded the hugely hyped film from being shown in many countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Egypt, and Indonesia. The virtue-signaling promotion of the film, which turned off many filmgoers even in the US, backfired in spectacular fashion. Lightyear bombed at the box office, ultimately losing Disney upwards of $100 million. Overall, Disney is now struggling financially, with its stock price down 39% for the year. Then-CEO Bob Chapek, meanwhile, has doubled down on his commitment to support the woke community. I pledge to be a better ally of the LGBTQ+ community, apologize for not being the ally you needed me to be, and committed to ensuring that our company lives up to its values. Perhaps it would have been a wiser move for Chapek to try and mend the bridges with those viewers who used to turn to Disney for wholesome family entertainment. But those people hardly care about Disney employees sexual orientation, which the company is allowing to be expressed so freely. Our leadership over there has been so welcoming to my, like, not-at-all-secret gay agenda, Latoya Raveneau, an executive producer for Disney Television, said in a video obtained by journalist Christopher Rufo. I was just, wherever I could, just basically adding queerness No one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me. Probably because it's not that deep. Her ""gay agenda"" is to get more diversity and representation into Disney stuff. All these commenters are so paranoid they can't help putting their own spin on things. After these adding queerness revelations came to light in April,a surveyby the Trafalgar Group found that more than 68% of general-election voters said they were less likely to do business with Disney, while more than 69% of respondents said they were likely to support family-friendly alternatives to Disney, sparse though they are. The cruel irony here is that it will be Disney employees who suffer from its lack of courage. As the House of Mouse continues to pander to a tiny segment of the population, profits sink and employees become redundant. Disney challenged the popular conservative governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, over the Parental Rights in Education bill. The Don t Say Gay bill is what activists have dubbed it, a name that implies some sort of totalitarian repression of free speech. This sinister piece of legislation, which caused Disney employees to stage a walkout in protest, states that instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity is not allowed to be taught in any classroom before fourth grade to children younger than nine or ten. I am just guessing here, but it seems the overwhelming majority of Americans would agree with those conditions. By flaunting its virtue-signaling credentials, Disney missed a golden opportunity to reconnect with millions of American parents who are dismayed that everything is becoming hyper-sexualized these days from the graphic books that children can find in their school libraries to the films in the theater.

"20 Nov, 2022",Operation Uranus: The day Hitler s Nazis were smashed and the Soviet Union began to take the upper hand in WW2,"Berlin didn t expect Moscow s maneuver, which came at roughly the midpoint of the five-month long Battle of Stalingrad On February 2, Russia celebrates the Day of Military Honor. Exactly 80 years ago on this day, the Red Army won the bloodiest fight in human history the Battle of Stalingrad. The victory of the USSR was brought about by the successful counter-offensive operation Uranus . This feature was first published on November 20, 2022, the 80th anniversary of the beginning of that counter-offensive. Early in the morning, exactly 80 years ago, the soldiers of the 3rd Romanian Army were awakened in their cold dugouts on the right bank of the Don River by the roar of artillery hitting their positions. By lunchtime, Commander Petre Dumitrescu reported to the leadership of Army Group South that it was impossible to prevent the enemy from crossing the river. A day later, his group was shredded by massive tank strikes. Two weeks later, it practically ceased to exist. At that point, the Soviet troops of the Southwestern Front under the command of Nikolai Vatutin began their part of Operation Uranus, which resulted in the first major strategic defeat for the Axis countries the beginning of the end. For the Allies, the Battle of Stalingrad would long stand as a symbol of military fortitude and Russian military genius. What were the key mistakes of the German command? What revolutionary warfare methods did the Soviet generals employ during the Battle of Stalingrad? What non-obvious consequences did the disruption of the German offensive in southern Russia have? A decisive November The autumn of 1942 is considered the turning point in World War II. The seemingly relentless offensive of the Axis powers and their seizure of new territories and resources were finally put to an end in all theaters. By December, the strategic advantage had swung to the Allies. After this, only they would dictate the course of the war, and the Germans and the Japanese could only react. Of course, the British would claim that the tide was turned in Egypt near El Alamein on October 24, when Bernard Montgomery managed to beat the Desert Fox Erwin Rommel and his African Corps, who were exhausted by a shortage of supplies. This put an end to German attempts to invade Egypt and block the Suez Canal, which would have significantly complicated the situation for England, since the island nation was extremely dependent on food and resources supplied by its colonies. Two weeks later, the British in North Africa were already supported by the Americans in the West, who were conducting Operation Torch a large-scale troop landing in Morocco and Algeria, which were formally under the control of France s pro-Hitler Vichy government. Despite Rommel s stubborn resistance in Tunisia, the outcome of the campaign was a foregone conclusion. However, the Americans themselves tend to believe that the outcome of the war in the fall of 1942 was decided not in North Africa, but on the opposite side of the world on the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific. The landmass was of great strategic importance, as control over it made it possible to secure commercial shipping between Australia and the United States and threaten the large Japanese naval base in Rabaul (New Britain). In August, US Marine Corps units landed on the island and immediately captured an important airbase, later called Henderson Field. Throughout the autumn, the Marines successfully defended this site with the support of aviation and the navy. The decisive battle was on November 13-14, when the Japanese lost their entire landing force, which was supposed to support the garrison of Guadalcanal, as well as several large ships, including the battleships Hiei and Kirishima. Japan s expansion to the south was checked at the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and it only lost previously captured territories after December of 1942. But, in point of fact, neither Hitler nor Stalin had any doubts that the future of the world was being determined on the Volga steppes from November 19 to 24, when 270,000 Wehrmacht troops under the command of Friedrich Paulus were forced into a cauldron by a heavy blow from the Southwestern and Stalingrad fronts. The subsequent failure to unblock the encircled units doomed the Blau plan and killed any hopes Berlin had for a successful outcome to the war. The German General Staff called the plan of action on the eastern front Fall Blau , or Blue. The main goal of the campaign in the summer of 1942 was initially to capture the oil fields of Maikop and Grozny. The fuel reserves stored in Germany before the war were coming to an end, and synthetic fuel and Romanian oil from Ploiesti were not enough to service all of the Wehrmacht s tanks and Luftwaffe s planes. Therefore, the offensive in the Caucasus was considered a priority. Stalingrad was a secondary goal, and storming the city was not envisaged. It would be enough to pummel it with constant artillery fire, as was the case with Leningrad. However, at first things went so well for the Germans that capturing the industrial and transport center on the Volga began to look like an easy and even natural task. This deceptively low-hanging fruit eventually buried the Third Reich. The Red Army s failures in the spring and summer were primarily due to Stalin s and the Soviet High Command s mistakes in assessing the enemy s plans. The fact is that the invasion of the USSR was initially dictated by the need to seize the resources of Ukraine and the North Caucasus. It was the seizure of the Lebensraum im Osten the living space in the East that Hitler and Rosenberg first thought about when authorizing the Barbarossa plan. This was also anticipated by Stalin, who concentrated his main forces in the west of Ukraine in 1941. Due to the suddenness of the attack and catastrophic errors in management, these troops were destroyed in the Battle of the Border and later near Odessa and Kiev. But the German generals, led by Chief of General Staff Franz Halder and Paulus the main drafter of the Barbarossa plan (such is the historical irony) were able to convince the Fuhrer of the need to repeat the blitzkrieg that brought victory in France. They considered it possible to destroy or trap the main part of the Soviet army in cauldrons with tank spearheads, after which they could take the enemy s capital and force a surrender. However, the stubborn resistance of the Red Army near Smolensk and Moscow proved that such calculations were a mistake, even if not yet fatal. In the 1942 campaign, Stalin was sure his adversary would try to finish what he had begun and take Moscow. Therefore, the main forces of the Red Army were concentrated in the central part of the country. But this time Hitler had no choice he had to urgently ensure the safety of the Kuban agricultural fields and the mines of Donbass, get Grozny oil, and prepare an offensive on the Baku and Azerbaijani oil fields. The Red Army forces weak position in the south deteriorated further after an incompetent attempt by Semyon Timoshenko s troops to retake Kharkov in May. As a result of a counteroffensive conducted by the 6th Paulus Army and 1st Panzer Group Kleist, 240,000 Soviet soldiers and officers were captured in the Barvenkov cauldron alone. The front actually collapsed, and what official reports called a strategic retreat was, in practice, more like an escape. It was at this moment that Hitler, inspired by this success, decided to divide Army Group South into two parts. The first was sent to the south to fulfill the main mission of capturing the oil fields, which by that time had already been set on fire by Soviet oilmen, with a subsequent strike on Rostov-on-Don. The second consisting of the 6th Paulus Army, the 4th Goth Tank Army, and two armies made up of Romanians, Hungarians, and Italians was to pursue the Soviet units retreating to the east with the aim of besieging Stalingrad and capturing Astrakhan by winter. While controlling Astrakhan would have completely cut central Russia off from Caucasian oil, Hitler saw the attack on Stalingrad more as a personal blow to the enemy s leader, as the city bore his name. It was here in 1918 that Stalin found his most loyal political ally, Voroshilov, as well as his main enemy, Trotsky. It was also here that American engineers had built one of the symbols of Stalin s industrialization policy, representing the industrial power of the USSR a colossal tractor plant. The resistance to the main onslaught, which was organized by the 62nd and 64th Armies on the distant approaches to the city, was weak and clearly ineffective in steppe conditions. It seemed to the German command that the Russians were about to finally run out of strength, and the last defenders of the city would die in its ruins amidst the smoke and fires from incessant bombing. How wrong they were. Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov was recalled to Stalingrad from China, where he had served as a military attach√© and chief military advisor to Chiang Kai-shek since December 1940. He had thus missed the initial stage of the Great Patriotic War, although he had been asking to be sent to the frontlines ever since the fighting started. It may just be that not having the weight of the bitter defeats of the first year of the war on his shoulders gave Chuikov the moral fortitude to keep defending Stalingrad till the end. What made him famous though was his personal courage, doggedness, strictness bordering on rudeness, and even a certain daredevil attitude. Back in July 1942, his plane was shot down by a German fighter while he was inspecting his defense positions. Three months later, on October 14, as the city was being stormed for the third time, even his nerves of steel were beginning to rattle as the army headquarters was hit with a projectile. Chuikov suffered a blast injury, dozens of army staff members died. And yet he remained firmly committed to his motto: There is no land for us behind the Volga. What did Stalingrad look like in September-October 1942? It was a narrow strip, hardly more than 1km wide, of densely built residential and industrial areas that had been devastated by bombing and shelling. Buried in the rubble were the corpses of several thousand civilians and soldiers from both sides. The air was foul with the stench of burning factories: Red October, Barrikady, the brick plant, and, of course, the giant Stalingrad Tractor Plant. Oil was burning and seeping from storage tanks into the Volga, as barges and boats carried reinforcements from the left bank to the right and wounded soldiers from the right bank to the left at night under relentless enemy aircraft fire. By mid-November, the Soviet 62nd Army s line of defense had been split into several islands. It is difficult to give exact numbers because fighting continued nonstop, but experts say there were no more than 20,000 Soviet troops along the actual line of contact and about three times as many German soldiers from General Paulus Sixth Army (with the total size of the German group estimated at about 270,000). A lot of the action was almost hand-to-hand combat. Trapped by rubble and barricades, German tanks couldn t maneuver and became an easy target for antitank guns and Molotov cocktails. Frontlines would run across staircases in apartment buildings, with Soviets often mounting counteroffensives at night approaching from basements, attics, or sewer pipes. Snipers attracted a lot of attention, with Soviet propaganda extolling Vasily Zaitsev as a hero. His legendary, albeit not entirely corroborated by historical evidence, duel with the chief instructor of a German sniper school was the inspiration for Enemy at the Gates , a Hollywood movie, where Zaitsev, a simple lad from the Urals region of Russia, is played by Jude Law. According to veterans reports, however, it was not the sniper rifle that decided the outcome of the Battle of Stalingrad but the simple PPSh submachine-gun, with its very high rate of fire and close combat effectiveness. Before Stalingrad, there had been virtually no historical precedent of fighting in big, built-up cities, except perhaps the siege of Madrid by General Franco s forces. There were no manuals or guidelines describing urban fighting. Chuikov and his soldiers wrote those rules with blood on the destroyed walls of buildings. The general and his army, later renamed the 8th Guards Army, drew on that experience later during the Battle for Berlin, which fell within a week. Since then, cities rather than fields and woods have increasingly seen the fiercest fighting, from Warsaw, Konigsberg, and Seoul to Grozny, Fallujah, and Mariupol. Modern warfare was born in Stalingrad. Temperatures fell sharply to 18-20 degrees Celsius below zero at night in early November. As the German Sixth Army, worn out by a months-long offensive, freezing, decimated by bloody urban fighting, and suffering from inconsistent supplies along the few steppe roads, which autumn rains had turned into mud, was persevering in its attempts to carry out Hitler s orders and push Chuikov s army into the river, its fate was decided hundreds of kilometers away from Stalingrad at the flanks of the overextended front that were protected by poorly equipped and under-motivated Romanian armies. It was there that the main strikes of Operation Uranus were delivered on November 19 and 20. Uranus was the first in a series of brilliant Red Army operations, which already bore many of the hallmarks that came to define the strategy of the Soviet General Staff. First was the highly unpredictable choice of the main strike areas, as the attacks were not aimed at the flanks of the Sixth Army itself but rather at areas deep behind it. Second, maximum secrecy was adhered to during the preparation period to conceal the true intentions from the enemy. The perceived hopelessness of the resistance on the part of the defenders of Stalingrad lulled Hitler into assuming, until the very last, that the Red Army was fighting at the top of its capabilities and had no resources for a counteroffensive. Third, unorthodox solutions were found to complex problems and ample supplies were provided to the attacking forces. A case in point is the airborne mission to supply antifreeze to the mechanized units of the 51st and 57th Armies that were being deployed in the steppes south of Stalingrad. The cold snap was forcing armor crews to dig pits under their tanks, cover them with tarps for protection and keep fires burning under them to prevent water coolant from freezing and destroying the engines. In the absence of a proper road system, it was impossible to deliver enough antifreeze within the short period of time left before the launch of the offensive. Eventually, over 60 tons of antifreeze coolant was brought from the Moscow region by air using cargo gliders. In the course of a week, pilots completed about 60 resupply missions, flying in a semi-reclined position inside plywood contraptions in freezing cold, often at night. Finally, Uranus was the first major operation executed in accordance with the deep operations theory developed by Vladimir Triandafillov in the 1920s. The theory, which emphasizes destroying enemy forces not only at the line of contact but throughout the depth of the battlefield, was refined and introduced into the Red Army manual by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. After Stalin s purges of the military in 1937 and Tukhachevsky s execution, the theory was declared wrong and even harmful. Yet it was borne out by practice and was crucial for the success of the Battle of Stalingrad. The same approach was used with the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of the Dnieper, Operation Bagration, the Vistula-Oder offensive, and many others. Traditionally, the main outcomes of the Battle of Stalingrad are said to be the frustration of Germany s offensive plans, Moscow retaining control over oil supplies from Baku along the Volga, the Wehrmacht s large-scale retreat, the protection of the Caucasus from further German advances, the fact that the Red Army now had the strategic initiative, and a major boost to the Soviet troops morale after such a decisive victory culminating in the capture of a German field marshal. The foreign-policy dimension is also frequently discussed, as it paved the way, in the winter of 1943, for the first negotiations between the Allies about the post-war spheres of influence, which eventually led to the Tehran Conference. However, there is one important consideration that is usually ignored because it goes way beyond one theater and has to do with the bigger picture of the war. What if, instead of getting bogged down in Stalingrad, Hitler had continued with his initial plan of capturing the Caucasus? What if he and his high command had been more realistic in assessing their capabilities? What if the Germans had succeeded in crushing Chuikov s 62nd Army after all? Just before the Second Battle of El Alamein, Erwin Rommel had to leave his army and return to Europe to treat his diphtheria. As he was preparing to hand over command to his subordinate, Rommel wrote a detailed memo for the Fuhrer describing the situation at hand and asking him to advance into the Caucasus as soon as possible. If the German troops had not been immobilized in Stalingrad in the summer of 1942 and had instead moved into Transcaucasia, Britain would have been forced to transfer its troops from Africa to northern Iran. Pro-German sentiment was strong in Iraq, while Syria and Lebanon were controlled by the collaborationist French Vichy regime. Turkey, which remained neutral until almost the very end of the war, had strong economic ties to Germany. After the defeat in World War I stripped Berlin of its colonies, the revival of the country s economy was mainly due to new markets in the Balkans and Turkey. Surrounded by the Germans on all sides, Ankara would likely have joined the Axis, especially given the prevalence of nationalist and revanchist sentiment in the country, as well as the age-long dream of seizing control over southern Azerbaijan from Iran. This development would have changed the situation globally, creating a new theater and threatening British oil production in Iran. Ultimately, it would have improved Germany s chances of winning the war, or at least protracting it by a year or two. In any case, November 1942 would certainly not be seen as the turning point of World War II today.

"19 Nov, 2022",Russia and Egypt start new nuclear reactor construction,"The project, led by Russia's Rosatom, is Egypt s first nuclear power plant Russian state-owned energy giant Rosatom has begun building a second reactor at the El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Egypt, Rosatom s press service told RIA Novosti on Saturday. The four-reactor El-Dabaa plant is situated some 300km northwest of Egypt's capital, Cairo. The project was launched back in 2017, while construction began this past July. The planned four nuclear reactors for the plant are expected to operate at a full capacity of 4.8 GW by 2030. The launch of the NPP will play a critical role in Egypt s socio-economic and technological life and will give impetus to the gradual transition of the country s industry and economy to low-carbon energy sources. It will create a solid foundation for Egypt's confident and sustainable development for decades to come, Rosatom Director General Aleksey Likhachev said at the ceremony, as cited by the news outlet. He noted that construction of the second reactor is currently proceeding ahead of schedule, a sign that the project is gaining momentum. El-Dabaa will be Egypt s first NPP and the first such facility on the African continent built with Russian technology. It is also the largest joint Russian-Egyptian project since construction of the Aswan Dam, Likhachev noted. In addition to Rosatom, major Egyptian contractors are also involved in building the El-Dabaa plant. The project is jointly financed by Moscow and Cairo. The Russian government is providing 85% of the $30 billion cost in the form of a state loan, while the rest is being funded by Egypt. Under the terms of the deal signed by the two countries, Rosatom will supply the nuclear fuel for the plant for its 60-year design lifetime and will carry out maintenance and repairs for ten years after the launch of each reactor.

He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Despite the recent signing of a historic maritime border agreement, tensions continue to remain high, with both Israel and the United States attempting to force Lebanon into compliance with their regional agenda. Although Israeli and Lebanese leaderssignedletters of intent earlier this month ending their long-standing maritime border dispute and averting a major escalation in their ongoing conflict, the two sides still remain technically at war. Beirut refuses to recognise the Israeli state, maintaining the stance that first the Palestine issue must be resolved, as Israel maintains control over the Shebaa Farms area which Lebanon claims to be its territory. Last week, drone strikes were reported to have killedup to 25people after targetinga fuel aid convoythat had just passed the Al-Qaim crossing into Syria from Iraq. There are conflicting reports on who actually carried out the attack, with both Israel and the United States accused of having been behind it. The US military instantly distanced themselves from the incident, bydenyingthey had carried out any strikes, whilst the Israeli government refused to comment and is now widely assumed to be culpable. According to Iraqi authorities, the fuel trucks, numbering 22 according to Iranian state-media, were approved for heading out of the country and seemed to be part of Iran s new agreement with Lebanon to provide free fuel. Despite opposition from top US officials, in August Lebanese Prime Minister Nijab Mikatiacceptedan offer from Tehran to supply Lebanon with fuel free of charge. Although the US ambassador to Lebanon, Dorothy Shea, had warned Beirut not to take the offer from Iran, it was decided that going ahead with receiving the Iranian gift was in the Lebanese national interest. It is likely that the temporary US silence following this was in large part to do with the then-ongoing maritime border dispute between Israel and Lebanon. The US has repeatedly attempted to counter Iranian influence in Lebanon, even going as far as claiming Beirut isnot in need of the Iranian fuel, whereas the country is clearly in a state of economic collapse and suffers a shortage. After Hezbollah, one of Lebanon s most popular political parties, organized Iranian fuel shipments in 2021, Washington quickly took to countering any future attempts for Tehran to come to the aid of the Lebanese economy. A deal was thenorganizedin September of 2021, under US supervision, for Egypt to supply natural gas through Jordan and Syria into Lebanon, in order to ease the energy crisis. However, the US government had pledged to amend its Caesar Act sanctions that it currently implements against Damascus to allow for the deal to go ahead, buthas so far failed to do so. Although the Lebanese State is now quickly taking to exploring and, it hopes, extracting natural gas from the offshore Qana prospect, which it secured its rights to under its maritime border agreement with Israel, this process could take years to bear fruit. In the short term, Lebanon needs a solution to its energy crisis and Iran is offering free fuel to supplement part of its needs. The US and its close ally Israel see this as a plot between Hezbollah and Iran to take control over the Lebanese State. Although Lebanon is technically an independent state, the reality is that France, the US and the Gulf States, particularly Saudi Arabia, hold huge shares of influence in the political and economic affairs of the country, and none of them feel comfortable with the idea of Tehran having a significant influence. The regional strategy of the United States government, which Israel is also in lockstep with, is to combat the influence of the Iranian government. Part of this strategy is to pressure more Arab States to normalize ties with Israel and to give up on the consensus amongst Arab League States to adhere to the Arab Peace Initiative. The initiative maintained that recognition of Israel by Arab states, along with the establishment of military, economic and political ties, could not come without the realisation of a Two-State solution under which the creation of a viable Palestinian State would be established. So far the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt, Sudan and Jordan have all normalized ties with Israel, abandoning the Palestinian cause for statehood. The US Biden administration is clearly seeking to add Saudi Arabia to the list, but eventually wants to go further than that. At the recent COP27 climate meeting, held in Egypt s Sharm el-Sheikh, Lebanese, Iraqi and Israeli representatives were all photographed standing near each other and had agreed to a distantcooperationon combating climate change. In Israeli and US media, this has been framed as somewhat of a breakthrough, despite being officially undermined by both Baghdad and Beirut. What is certain, however, is that the US and Israel are continuing to send a message to Lebanon, that they will not let it simply go about its business and thrive without adhering to their own agenda. Hence the US has not allowed for the Egypt-Jordan-Syria deal for transfer of fuel into Lebanon. The most insidious part of the stance maintained by the US government is that Lebanon cannot simply leave the Iranian sphere of influence altogether and Washington is well aware of this. As long as Lebanese Hezbollah remains a popular force in the country, there will always be a link between Tehran and Beirut. This means that the US policy is designed to punish the Lebanese people for not getting rid of Hezbollah, something that neither the US nor Israel will dare try to do themselves. If Israel and the US are both in lockstep about preventing Iranian fuel from reaching Lebanon, then this means that they are simply depriving Lebanon of its ability to get back on its feet, all in the name of combating Iran and Hezbollah. In their eyes, if the Lebanese people perceive the Iranian fuel imports to be their saving grace, this runs counter to US hegemony and, together with the latest perceived victory for Hezbollah in forcing the Israelis to negotiate a maritime border settlement, Tehran would come off with greater support in Lebanon. The US and Israel are proving incapable of allowing the Lebanese people to achieve a greater standard of life, due to the fact that Hezbollah and Iran are still there. Meanwhile, getting rid of Hezbollah would not only be militarily impossible, but there is also no evidence that such a move would actually bring stability as evidenced with the case of Sudan, which normalized ties with Israel and earned itself a place in the good books of the US government, but the West is yet to aid the country, which endures a continuous state of crisis.",https://www.rt.com/news/566510-israel-iran-leave-lebanon/
"15 Nov, 2022",Humanity marks major milestone,"The global population has surpassed eight billion, according to UN estimates The world s population officially passed the eight billion mark on Tuesday morning, the United Nations said, celebrating the milestone with a counting clock on its website. In astatementon the Day of Eight Billion, the UN paid tribute to improvements in public health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine factors leading to a gradual increase in the average human lifespan, which is expected to reach 77.2 years by 2050. However, the organization pointed to the slowing growth rate, uneven levels of fertility across the planet, and markedly older populations in many countries. The milestone is an occasion to celebrate diversity and advancements while considering humanity's shared responsibility for the planet, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. According to the World Population ProspectReport2022, released in July, global population growth is at its slowest since 1950, with the rate falling below 1% in 2020. According to UN projections, the population will reach 10.4 billion during the 2080s and remain at the same level until 2100. Just eight countries the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania are expected to account for more than half of the anticipated growth up to the 2050s. As those nations are among the world s poorest, their fast population growth means that eradicating poverty, combating hunger, and increasing health and education access in those countries will become even more challenging, the UN noted. Developed countries with low fertility rates face another issue: aging populations. In the 2050s, the proportion of people aged 65 or over will rise from the current 10% to 16% in 2050, becoming more than twice the number of children under the age of five. The UN called on countries with older populations to urgently adapt relevant public programmes, including establishing universal health care and long-term care systems. Commenting on the conclusions on the eve of the Day of Eight Billion, Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of the UN Population Fund, said that the milestone should be viewed as a rallying cry for change in a world suffering from inequality.

"13 Nov, 2022","The garden versus jungle worldview of the EU s top diplomat is not only racist, it s delusional","Josep Borrell s neocolonial comparison fails to notice the West s decline, caused by elites like him Graham Hryceis an Australian journalist and former media lawyer, whose work has been published in The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Sunday Mail, the Spectator and Quadrant. Graham Hryceis an Australian journalist and former media lawyer, whose work has been published in The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Sunday Mail, the Spectator and Quadrant. Josep Borrell, the European Union s foreign policy and security chief, gave an important speech to the European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Belgium in mid-October. Being amongst fellow members of the global elites, Borrell felt able to set out his views on the relationship between Europe and the West and other nations with an unusual degree of honesty and candour. Europe is a garden declared Borrell. We have built a garden. Everything works. It is the best combination of political freedom, economic prosperity and social cohesion that the humankind has been able to build the three things together. But, warned Borrell ominously, The rest of the world is not exactly a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden. How then was this unwelcome prospect to be avoided? The solution was simple, according to Borrell EU ambassadors, who he designated as gardeners, had to go to the jungle and impose on it the ideological, political, and economic agendas of the globalised West. The garden could not sit by idly and do nothing, cautioned Borrell. A nice small garden surrounded by high walls in order to prevent the jungle from coming in is not going to be a solution. Because the jungle has a strong growth capacity, the wall will never be high enough in order to protect the garden, Borrell explained. Europeans have to be much more engaged with the rest of the world otherwise the rest of the world will invade us by different ways and means, Borrell advised. Borrell s speech was immediately criticised by a few left-wing politicians in Europe, as well as some non-European states, most notably the UAE, on the grounds that it was racist and rooted in colonialism. Those criticisms are valid as far as they go, and Borrell grudgingly offered an apology of sorts saying I am sorry if some have felt offended. Nevertheless, he stood by his basic metaphor, reiterating that Regrettably, the world in which we live today looks more and more like a jungle and less and less like a garden . But much more serious criticisms can be legitimately levelled at Borrell s crass worldview censures that go well beyond the obvious fact that it simply reeks of nineteenth century Euro-centric prejudices. First, let us start with Borrell s extraordinary Pollyanna-like assertion that in Europe and the West everything works and that the garden nations are havens of political, economic, and social stability. This pronouncement will no doubt have come as a surprise to many citizens in Europe and the West. Has Borrell not noticed the recent rise of powerful right-wing political movements in a number of European countries? Is he not aware of the recent election results in Italy and Sweden? Have Borrell s advisors not informed him of the political instability that has engulfed the United Kingdom in recent months, let alone the crisis in democracy that has crippled the United States for the past two years? Has Borrell not noticed the dramatic recent rise in energy prices; rising inflation; rising interest rates; long-term wage stagnation; and the looming economic recession that is predicted to engulf many Western nations in the near future? Has Borrell not seen the tens of thousands of demonstrators marching in European capital cities in recent months? Is he unaware of the effects that EU austerity programs have had in many of the bloc s member nations in recent years? Does Borrell really believe that the garden nations will sail through the upcoming European winter unscathed? Has Borrell never heard of the so-called culture wars ? Has he not noticed the collapse of liberal institutions and values throughout the West in recent decades? Has the immigration crisis that has bedevilled Europe in recent years, and has recently engulfed the United Kingdom, not yet been brought to his attention? Borrell, of course, pointedly fails to mention that all of the problems listed above have been severely exacerbated by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In fact, Borrell does not seem to appreciate that the increasing political and economic instability within the garden nations makes it increasingly difficult if not impossible for them to pursue his misguided foreign policy agenda. Obviously, the view from Bruges differs from that from, say, Athens. Second, let us examine Borrell s prescription for exporting Western stability to the jungle states that languish threateningly outside the gates of the EU Garden of Eden. Borrell s solution is deceptively simple: just let the EU gardeners impose Western hegemony on those unstable jungle nations with, it almost goes without saying, the helpful assistance of the United States. Readers will not be surprised to learn that Borrell is a keen supporter of the United States. Last year he stated One thing is clear: close EU-US cooperation based on shared values is key for international peace, security and prosperity. Even if his Bruges speech did not explicitly include the US in his imaginary""garden"", he obviously does not think of it as part of""the rest of the world"". Borrell apparently has failed to notice that the US has spent the last few decades attempting to implement his foreign policy program in spades for example, in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. He seems unaware that these previous attempts to tame the jungle ended in chaos. Nor, of course, does he acknowledge that many of the problems that plague the jungle nations today were, in fact, caused by such misconceived interventions. Borrell s entire worldview is nothing more than a global elite fantasy designed, in part, to camouflage the unpalatable fact that the Western garden nations are, in fact, becoming more and more like the non-Western jungle countries that he despises and fears. Isn t the political, economic and social instability that today afflicts almost all Western nations in large part caused by the West s mistaken foreign policy excursions precisely the same instability that has beset some non-Western nations for decades? And, hasn t this instability intensified dramatically in the West in recent years? Test that proposition by way of a comparison relating to political stability. Brazil has experienced chronic political instability for decades. Prior to the recent presidential election, President Jair Bolsonaro announced that he would not accept the election result if he lost. In the United States, former President Trump refused to accept his election defeat in 2020, culminating in the January 6 capitol riots. Trump and dozens of candidates endorsed by him have since maintained their position that Joe Biden s 2020 victory was illegitimate. Bolsonaro narrowly lost the recent presidential election in Brazil but, after his defeat, he did accept the result, even if his supporters staged mass protests in the streets. Trump and many of his candidates are now refusing to accept the results of the US mid-term elections let alone the 2020 result and Trump intends to run again for president in 2024. Looking at the two countries relative political stability, where does one put the""garden""fence? Just this week two important events highlighted just how divorced from reality Borrell s worldview actually is. First, at the COP27 conference in Egypt, the jungle asserted its autonomy by demanding payment of billions of dollars in reparations for the damage done to its countries by climate change. This demand lies completely outside Borrell s crude frame of reference, and, perhaps more disturbingly, seems completely justified by the EU s own catastrophic climate change ideology. I suspect that the EU gardeners will find any such reparations a tough sell to EU citizens who cannot pay their energy bills this winter. Second, it now appears that the Biden administration is placing increasing pressure on Vladimir Zelensky to negotiate a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine and that this pressure will intensify once the Republicans take control of the US House of Representatives. Where this leaves a fervent and uncritical supporter of the conflict like Borrell or Zelensky for that matter is not yet clear. Borrell is nothing more than a rather unsophisticated representative of the global elites that have blindly and rapaciously presided over the decline of European and Western political and economic stability in recent decades. That being so, it is perfectly apt that he should find himself in charge of EU foreign policy and security at the present time because, as Cyril Connolly once famously prophesied, it now appears that it is closing time in the gardens of the West.",https://www.rt.com/news/566364-borrell-garden-jungle-racist/
"13 Nov, 2022",Developing nations demand rich countries pay for climate change,"Western economies are accused of being the world s biggest polluters while calling for slashing emissions Leaders from developing countries have accused wealthy nations and the energy industry of triggering climate change and demanded compensation for the damage it has inflicted on their economies. While oil and gas companies are reaping the benefits, small island states are being devastated by ocean storms caused by rising sea levels, they say. Speaking at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt on Tuesday, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne noted that oil and gas industry continues to earn almost $3 billion daily in profits, while the planet is burning. It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global carbon tax on their profits as a source of funding for loss and damage, Browne added. Poor nations point at the hypocrisy of their wealthier counterparts, which are the most vocal advocates of slashing emissions while themselves being the biggest polluters following a century of fossil fuel-driven industrialization. Developing countries are now asking how they will be compensated for the floods and droughts attributed to climate change. I m not here to ask any of you to love the people of my country with the same passion as I do, said the prime minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis. I m asking what is it worth to you to have millions of climate refugees to turn into tens of millions, putting pressure on political and economic systems around the world. Meanwhile, Senegalese President Macky Sall admitted that his country s economy is unable to shift away from fossil fuels immediately but said that poorer developing countries in Africa needed increased funding from wealthy nations in order to adapt to the worsening climate. Let s be clear, we are in favor of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. But we Africans cannot accept that our vital interests be ignored, he said.

""Now that we're back together here in Cambodia I want to thank the prime minister of Colombia for his leadership as ASEAN chair and for hosting all of us,""Biden said, seemingly intending to refer to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is currently chairing the ten-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc.

The incident was the second time in a week that Biden confused the conflict in Ukraine with the US campaign in Iraq two decades earlier, and came several months after he publicly praised the Iranian people, intending to refer to Ukrainians. Biden has also forgotten the names of his own officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, and foreign leaders, such as Australia s Scott Morrison, and often stumbles through teleprompter-assisted speeches. Despite turning 80 next week, Biden insists that he intends to run for office again in 2024, when he will turn 82.

The outlet conceded, however, that China and possibly several other key players would be highly unlikely to follow suit. We try to work with partners in order to show very, very, very firmly what the international community thinks about all these crimes, atrocities, and illegal actions by Russia, a spokesperson for the EU s foreign affairs service told the paper. The spokesperson explained that the bloc, together with the UK, will not only shun Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and stage walkouts during addresses by Moscow s delegation, but also try to convince other nations to do the same. According to the anonymous official, while the UK is not keen on coordinating with the EU on foreign policy in general, the concerted efforts to isolate Russia have proven to be an exception, as London and Brussels have the same objective. The report also quoted a French government source as saying that the meeting in Bali will not be business as usual and will center on the Ukraine conflict. There will be a coalition and Russia is isolated, the official concluded. The article noted, however, that the total isolation of Russia at the event is unlikely, as the country enjoys close relations with China. One unnamed EU official told the paper that Moscow and Beijing are expected to water down any joint statement calling for de-escalation in Ukraine. The report also suggested that the likes of India, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, which have not joined Western sanctions against Moscow, could break ranks with the EU and UK this time as well. Relations between Moscow and the West have hit an all-time low in the wake of the Russian military operation in Ukraine. However, Moscow has insisted that any attempts to isolate the country will fail. The key organizations that Russia is part of, such as BRICS, are also expanding. In fact, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed following a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last month that Riyadh would like to join BRICS, which currently comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. On top of that, media reports claimed back in July that Turkiye and Egypt might also be interested.

"9 Nov, 2022",125 billionaires have carbon footprint the size of France Oxfam,"Group of wealthy individuals cause 393 million tons of CO2 emissions each year, a study concluded The world s richest people cause huge and unsustainable amounts of carbon emissions, and unlike ordinary people, 50% to 70% of their pollution results from their investments, anti-poverty charity Oxfam has revealed. According to itsreportreleased on Monday, 125 of the world s richest billionaires on average emit three million tons of CO2 each per year, more than a million times the average for someone in the less-wealthy 90% of humanity. The billionaires have a collective $2.4 trillion stake in 183 companies, the study said. The actual pollution figure is likely to be higher still, Oxfam says, as the available data on corporate carbon emissions has been shown to systematically underestimate the true impact. Billionaires and corporates who do not publicly reveal their emissions, and therefore could not be included in the research, are likely to be those with a high climate impact. These few billionaires together have investment emissions that equal the carbon footprints of entire countries like France, Egypt or Argentina, said Nafkote Dabi, Climate Change Lead at Oxfam. These billionaire investors at the top of the corporate pyramid have huge responsibility for driving climate breakdown. They have escaped accountability for too long, she stressed. According to the campaigner, emissions from billionaire lifestyles, including their private jets and yachts, are thousands of times those of the average person. However, carbon emissions from their investments are over a million times higher. The study also found that billionaires had an average of 14% of their investments in polluting industries such as energy and materials such as cement. That is twice the average for investments in the S&P 500 companies. Only one billionaire in the sample had investments in a renewable energy company, Oxfam said.

We have agreed that the BCC will meet in the near future. Under the terms of the New START treaty, the work of the BCC is confidential, but we do hope for a constructive session, Price said at a press briefing. The US believes in the transformative power of diplomacy and dialogue but is clear-eyed and realistic about what it can accomplish when it comes to Russia, Price added. The conversations are focused on risk-reduction but Washington wants to ensure that the ability to pass messages back and forth with Moscow does not atrophy. If there is, and it sounds like there will be, a meeting of the BCC, that is a good thing, Price added, before correcting himself to say that the meeting will definitely happen. While Price would not name the venue for the meeting,Bloombergmentioned Cairo as a neutral location that is more acceptable to Russia than Geneva, since Switzerland has taken part in the US and EU sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict.

Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish, Guterres told delegates gathered to discuss how to combat change amid an ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and rising global inflation and energy shortages. Guterres insisted that the world s richest and poorest counties must form a pact to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels, singling out China and the United States as two countries that have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality. It is either a climate solidarity pact or a collective suicide pact. Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible, Guterres said, proclaiming that we are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.

She argued that global warming can only be solved by a system-wide transformation, according to a write-up of the event by the Telegraph. The capitalist system, Thunberg continued, is defined by colonialism, imperialism, oppression and genocide by the so-called global North to accumulate wealth that still shapes our current world order. If economic growth is our only priority, then what we are experiencing now should be exactly what we should be expecting, she added, before calling the extraction of fossil fuels racist.

Thunberg replied to these critics on Wednesday, stating that she is not advocating for a return to socialism, liberalism, communism, conservatism, centrism, you name it, which she said have all failed.

Speaking at an SCO videoconference on Tuesday, Mishustin said the strongest pressure from the collective West had been applied to Russian sport in recent months because of the conflict in Ukraine. Russian athletes have faced widespread bans from international competitions since Moscow began its military campaign in February something which Mishustin said was contrary to the principle of sport remaining outside politics. The SCO member states are unanimous that sports competitions should remain an effective and accessible tool for building trust and mutual understanding between peoples Together we must fight any attempts to destroy the lofty principles of Olympism, Mishustin said at an SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting, in comments shared byTASS. Last month at an SCO summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Russian President Vladimir Putinsuggested that the organization could set up a formal associationof sports federations. It was recently noted by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko that the collective population of the SCO nations numbers in the billions, providing a huge potential audience for sporting collaboration. Elsewhere, Russian officials have consistently talked up the idea of more competitions with members of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) nations. Mishustin said on Tuesday that a sports association within the SCO would serve to strengthen cooperation. It will bring together representatives of such structures of the states that are members of the SCO, BRICS, the EAEU (Eurasian Economic Union) and the CIS, while being open to other participants, said the Russian official. Athletes from our countries will be able to demonstrate their achievements in a fair fight at major competitions. Moreover, the emphasis will be placed not only on professional, but first of all for mass sports. Ina joint communiqueissued after Tuesday s meeting, the SCO said that it would work towards boosting relations in the field of physical culture and sport. [Participants] noted the proposal of the Russian Federation to create an Association of Sports Organizations under the auspices of the SCO and establish a Working Group on Physical Culture and Sports within the framework of this Meeting, the statement added.

"1 Nov, 2022",Zelensky nullified grain shipping deal Moscow,"Vyacheslav Volodin says the agreement on Ukrainian grain exports can t continue on the old terms Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has rendered an internationally brokered grain shipping agreement void by using safe passage in the Black Sea to strike Russian warships, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia s parliament, has claimed. Moscow has asserted that Kiev dispatched attack drones, last weekend, via a route designated for grain vessels. The resumption of the grain deal is impossible as long as the safe corridor is being used for terrorist attacks, Volodin wrote on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. With his actions, Zelensky has nullified all of the agreements that were brokered by Turkiye and the UN. The senior legislator said the use of the safe corridor for the attack on Russia s Black Sea Fleet is unacceptable and that the grain agreement cannot exist on the old terms. Under the deal struck in July, the sides agreed to unblock the export of grain and other agricultural products from Ukrainian ports. Ukraine, a major producer, is among the vital suppliers of wheat, corn, and barley. On Saturday, Moscow accused Kiev of sending aerial and seaborne drones to strike warships in the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, which hosts a naval base. A minesweeper was damaged in the raid, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The ministry claimed that the drones moved along the corridor set up for grain ships, and that one device may have been launched from a civilian vessel hired to transport grain. Moscow also said that a British Navy unit masterminded the attack. London has dismissed the accusation. Russia subsequently announced the closure of the corridor on Monday. Zelensky accused Russia of blackmail and deliberately exacerbating the food crisis. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that only 3-5% of grain that had been shipped through the safe corridor went to poorer countries. The UN, however, reported last month that 27% of the ships went to low and lower-middle income countries such as Egypt, Kenya, and Bangladesh. It said that 26% went to upper-middle income countries such as Turkiye and China, while 47% went to high-income nations such as Spain and Italy.

"26 Oct, 2022",Research suggests how many burgers are safe for climate,"Limiting meat consumption could help keep 2030 global warming targets within reach, the State of Climate Action report said Eating no more than the equivalent of two burgers per week will contribute to the fight against climate change, newresearchconducted by several high-profile climate organizations and published on Wednesday has found. The State of Climate Action 2022 report assesses global progress on 40 indicators which are believed to be particularly important for keeping the Paris Agreement s 2030 climate targets within reach. One of the factors is formulated as Reduce daily per capita ruminant meat consumption to 79 kilocalories across high-consuming regions. According to the paper, shifting to healthier, more sustainable diets must accelerate five-fold, with meat consumption reducing to roughly two burgers per week across the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. Animal agriculture is widely believed to contribute to global warming because of the emissions of livestock, destruction of habitats, and greenhouse gas generation. The 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by almost 200 countries, requires the countries to halve their emissions by 2030 in order to limit global warming to 1.5 ∞C and thus reduce the effects of climate change. The report noted that between 2015 and 2019, the consumption of beef, lamb, and goat meat across high-consuming regions had reduced by 1.5%, reaching 91 kilocalories per capita per day in 2019. However, the speed of decline is far too slow to hit the 2030 target, the paper says. To avoid the increasingly dangerous, and in some cases, irreversible climate impacts, the process of phasing out coal, according to the report, should also accelerate six-fold, while decreases in annual deforestation rates should occur 2.5 times faster, and expanding public transportation should be six times quicker. Investments in global climate financing need to grow over 10 times faster, the report said, by approximately $460 billion every year this decade. Among the encouraging signs, the report listed the rise in use of zero-carbon power sources and the speedy transition to electric vehicles. According to Andrew Steer, the head of Bezos Earth Fund, which took part in research along with the World Resources Institute and Climate Action Tracker, the report should evoke two emotions: First, a sense of shame and anger that we are failing to live up to our commitments to act. Second, a sense of hope and possibility that real change is within grasp and can lead to a healthier economy, healthier citizens, and a healthier society. The authors of the report believe that it will be an invaluable handbook for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which will be held in November in Egypt, as well as for governments, civil society, and companies.

We provide [our people] with Russian grain this wasn t the case in the past. Since 2021, the process of grain acquisitions is changing inside Iran. Last year, I believe, we were in second place in our purchases from Russia. Next year we will, I think, be number one, the diplomat said at the Made in Russia forum. Tehran has become heavily dependent on grain imports in recent years. According to the country s Grain Union, it will need to import at least seven million tons of wheat in the year to March 2023, marking a second year of high imports following a drought that disrupted domestic production. Last year, the country imported 16.5 million tons of grain, with wheat making up about half of the total volumes, data from Iran s Ports and Maritime Organization showed. The statement by the Iranian ambassador comes amid a new record grain harvest in Russia. This year yields have exceeded 147 million tons, while volumes of wheat are about to reach 100 million tons, according to the country s Agriculture Ministry. It s expected that in the agricultural year 2022-2023 the country will export about 50 million tons of grain, including 39.5 million tons of wheat. Russia is the largest wheat exporter in the world, followed by Canada and the US. In the agricultural year 2021-2022, Russia delivered 38.1 million tons of grain, including 30.7 tons of wheat, mainly to Egypt, Turkey and countries in South Asia, and became the world s largest grain exporter, according to the country s Trade Minister Maksim Reshetnikov.

Ramaphosatold reportersof Riyadh s BRICS inquiry, as he wrapped up his two-day state visit to the desert kingdom on Sunday. The trip included meetings with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other Saudi leaders. The crown prince did express Saudi Arabia s desire to be part of BRICS, and they are not the only country, Ramaphosa said. The group, which is named for member states Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is scheduled to meet next year in Johannesburg for its annual summit. Expansion prospects will likely be high on the agenda, as the bloc is expected to consider adding such nations as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Algeria. TheBRICSnations are going to be meeting in a summit next year under the chairship of South Africa, and the matter is going to be under consideration, Ramaphosa said. And already, a number of countries or nations have been making approaches to the other member countries, and we ve given them the same answer to say it ll be discussed by the BRICS partners themselves, five of them, and thereafter a decision will be made. The State Visit to Saudi Arabia was about advancing diplomatic and political relations between our two countries, but it is the economic relations that underpinned the substance of our visit.#SAinSaudiArabiapic.twitter.com/zuVPODGy1c The Saudi-South Africa talks came amid a row between Riyadh and Washington over OPEC s decision to cut production quotas by 2 million barrels a day. US President Joe Biden last week threatened Saudi Arabia with unspecified consequences and accused the longtime ally of siding with Russia in the Ukraine crisis. US lawmakers have called for cutting off cooperation with Saudi Arabia, such as halting arms sales or withdrawing military support. Saudi PrinceSaud al-Shaalanresponded angrily on Saturday, warning Western leaders not to threaten the kingdom. Anybody that challenges the existence of this country and this kingdom, all of us, we are projects of jihad, and martyrdom. That s my message to anybody that thinks that he can threaten us. Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman said Saudi leaders were astonished by false US accusations that Riyadh is standing with Russia against Ukraine. Russia, China and other BRICS members are reportedly developing a new global reserve currency, potentially undermining the dominance of the US dollar. The addition of Saudi Arabia to the bloc would have potentially far-reaching implications, given that the dollar s strength stems partly from its status as the dominant currency in international oil markets. Saudi Arabia has reportedly considered selling crude inChinese yuan. Although the US and Saudi Arabia aren't formal allies, their partnership has been one of the most long-standing and mutually beneficial in the region. Riyadh is a major buyer of American arms.

The number of irregular crossings into the EU grew sharply in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the previous year, the bloc s border agency Frontex said Thursday. In the first nine months of this year, nearly 228,240 irregular entries were detected at the external borders of the European Union, according to preliminary calculations. This represents an increase of 70% compared with the same period last year and is the highest total recorded for the first three quarters of the year since 2016, the agency stated. The Western Balkans route has become the illegal migration hotspot this year, with over 100,000 irregular entries registered there. The majority of migrants seeking to enter the EU through this route come from Syria, Afghanistan and Turkiye, the agency noted. The Central Mediterranean route, where migrants take dangerous trips in open boats in a bid to enter the EU, remains the second most-popular, accounting for some 65,000 illegal entries. The majority of illegal migrants on this route come from Tunisia, Egypt and Bangladesh, according to Frontex. The illegal migration figures do not include the massive influx of refugees from Ukraine, Frontex noted, since they have been entering the bloc s territory through border checkpoints. According to the agency s latest figures, more than 11 million Ukrainian nationals have entered the EU from Ukraine, amid the ongoing conflict between Kiev and Moscow. However, an unspecified significant number of Ukrainians have already returned home, Frontex noted. ",https://www.rt.com/news/564633-eu-illegal-migration-figures/
"8 Oct, 2022",Will Lebanon and Israel go to war over their maritime border dispute?,"With Tel Aviv s military on alert and Hezbollah threatening to destroy Israeli oil and gas facilities, the dispute is teetering on the brink Israel has announced its readiness for war with Lebanon, as the ongoing US-mediated maritime border demarcation talks head towards a dead end. The issue, however, is not just causing dispute between Beirut and Tel Aviv, but also becoming more prevalent within Israeli politics as it heads into another round of general elections. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid rejected Lebanese amendments to a US-proposed maritime border demarcation agreement. The previous day, Israeli officials had reportedly been briefed on the deal, which was the cause of much optimism, with an unnamed sourcetelling Axios newsthat Lapid made it clear that Israel will not compromise on its security and economic interests, even if that means that there will be no agreement soon. Later on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz ordered the military establishment toprepare for an armed confrontation with Lebanon. A four-hour cabinet meeting, which was said to have been attended by major Israeli security establishment figures, was then concluded with a public announcement that the prime minister and defense minister had been granted permission to strike Lebanon without further cabinet approval. In early June, a ship owned by the gas company Energean arrived at the resource-rich Karish field in the Eastern Mediterranean to begin preparations for natural gas production for Israel. Lebanese President Michel Aoun condemned the arrival, warning Tel Aviv against taking any further aggressive action. The Karish field, as well as the nearby Qana field, have for years been central to on-off US-mediated negotiations between Lebanon and Israel. The two nations have still not come to any agreement on the demarcation of their maritime borders, with Beirut seeing Karish and Qana as vital to reviving its collapsing economy. While Lebanon maintains, due to legal arguments put forth in previous negotiations, that the entire area is to be considered disputed waters, Israel has maintained that all of the Karish field and the majority of the Qana field are within its own Exclusive Economic Zone . The Lebanese political and military party Hezbollah, which claims to have 100,000 battle-ready troops at its disposal, then weighed in on the debate,vowing to protect Lebanon s rights to its oil and gas. Secretary General of Lebanese Hezbollah Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah declared that if no maritime border deal were reached and Lebanon is not able to secure its rights, then military action will be taken. Nasrallah vowed that the new reality would be If we can t have our resources, nobody can. Hezbollah s red line is Israeli extraction from the Karish field before any agreement is signed if this happens, the group has threatened to strike not only Tel Aviv s infrastructure at site, but every other Israeli oil and gas facility in the Mediterranean. Israel has since responded with threats of its own, which have ranged from a vow to eliminate the entiredensely populated Beirut suburbthat serves as Hezbollah s stronghold, to Benny Gantz srecent warningthat the whole of Lebanon would pay a heavy price for any military action by Hezbollah. Now that the negotiations have reached a make or break point, there are significant fears that military action will be taken, either by Israel or Hezbollah. The most recent threats issued by the military and political leadership in Tel Aviv have caused panic among Israelis living near the Lebanese border. However, there is a significant possibility that the rhetoric is aimed at a domestic audience. Israel will enter into a new round of national elections in November and the demarcation of maritime borders has recently been weaponized against the current Israeli leadership, causing ministers to act in order to save face. Israeli opposition leader and former long-time prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu began to lash out at interim-PM Yair Lapid back in September,releasing a videoin which he claimed that Lapid had totally folded in the face of Nasrallah s threats and that Hezbollah had forced him to delay extraction from the Karish field. Netanyahu has continued to heavily criticize his political opponents handling of the demarcation-line issue, with similar claims that Israel is backing down over the threats issued by Lebanese Hezbollah. Netanyahu s words ring true in that Lapid has clearly been forced to take the issue of demarcation of maritime borders very seriously and has conceded on positions held by Tel Aviv in the past. In addition to this, the extraction of gas from the Karish field has also been delayed, as Energean, which owns the rights to extract from the site, was initially prepared to begin operations in late September and has so far refrained from doing so. However, had Netanyahu remained as PM, he would hardly have had any other choice but to do the same. The threats made by Hezbollah are very serious, and the group apparently has the capacity to follow through with them and destroy all of Israel s oil and gas facilities. At this time, however, the Israeli far-right camp headed by Netanyahu is blaming the situation on Lapid s weak governance, saying he is prepared to give away territory that belongs to Israel. For this reason, it is likely that Yair Lapid will attempt to delay extraction of gas from the Karish field in order to sideline the issue until after the elections. Lebanon sees the Karish and Qana issue as integral to its survival. Some UN experts put the percentage of Lebanese living in poverty at around 80%, while the country endures round-the-clock blackouts, a rising crime rate, and civil instability. Some people have even been spotted searching for food in garbage bins, as well as fighting over loaves of bread at bakeries. Getting its hands on a possible multi-billion-dollar oil and gas field is a matter of life or death for Beirut but not for Tel Aviv, which enjoys far more economic stability. The US mediator in the Lebanon-Israel talks, Amos Hochstein, gave aninterview to the American owned al-Hurra TVin June, laughing when asked about the prospect of trading the Karish field for Qana. Months later, after Hezbollah upped its threats and the group s leader, Nasrallah, stated that the Lebanese people would not be laughed at, this issue has become a rather grave one. The US, which has a clear pro-Israeli bias, is now being forced to take the talks much more seriously. Earlier this year, as the European Union looked for alternative gas suppliers, a deal was inked between Tel Aviv and Brussels, under which Israel would send gas through pipelines to Europe via Egypt. This has encouraged Tel Aviv to announce its plans to double its gas output, and the Karish field is key to achieving this. The Qana field, however, has not yet been explored and will take time to develop. Despite this, one of the key reasons for Israel s rejection of the Lebanese proposal is that Beirut refuses to pay Tel Aviv royalties for the gas it would extract from the Qana field should it be handed to Lebanon. Beirut cannot commit itself to such an agreement, because this would mean normalizing ties with the Tel Aviv regime, which still occupies Shebaa farms an area that Lebanon claims as its rightful territory. Whether war happens will now boil down to whether bickering between Israeli political parties and individual officials will cause Tel Aviv to adopt a belligerent approach and push forward with gas production in the disputed fields before an agreement is reached. If it does, there can be little doubt that Hezbollah will open fire if its red line is crossed. Israel s stake in the matter is additional energy revenues, while for Lebanon it is potentially a matter of life or death. Neither side wants war, but one has much to gain and the other has everything to lose. Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK.

It was officially confirmed on Wednesday that Ukraine will be incorporated into the Spanish-Portuguese campaign to win the hosting rights for the World Cup in eight years time. The details of the joint bid are yet to be finalized, although reports have stated that Ukraine is aiming to host one group of the 48-team tournament. Responding to the news, Russian Football Union (RFU) president Dyukov said that Ukrainian participation in the Spanish-Portuguese bid made little commercial sense. It is their right [to bid]. The application needs to be studied. I do not see any commercial or marketing logic in such an application, said the Russian football official on Wednesday, as reported byRIA Novosti. The incorporation of Ukraine did not make the initial bid stronger. I see nothing here except politics, added Dyukov, who serves as a UEFA Executive Committee member. Announcing their joint bid, the football authorities of Spain, Portugal and Ukraine talked it up as receiving unconditional support from the UEFA hierarchy. The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) described it as a global and transformative project of European football in an exceptional situation. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky gave the bid his full backing, writing on social media: The joint bid of Spain, Portugal and Ukraine to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup is more than a symbol of faith in our joint victory. Ukraine will endure, prevail and be rebuilt thanks to the solidarity of its partners. The bid is expected to face tough competition from a joint South American campaign comprising Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. Elsewhere, a possible three-way campaign from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Greece is being lined up. Morocco has also stated its intention to bid, possibly alongside Tunisia and Algeria. FIFA will formally announce the hosting rights at its congress in 2024. Ukraine does have experience of organizing a major tournament before, having hosted the UEFA 2012 European Championship alongside Poland.

"26 Sep, 2022",How Yemen s Cold War-era revolution set the stage for today s devastating Western-backed war,"Exactly 60 years ago, a conflict erupted in Yemen that became bloody and protracted September 26, 1962 is not only one of the most important dates in the history of Yemen, but also of modern Middle Eastern affairs, representing the beginning of what was a civil war to some and an international proxy conflict to others. With the massive death and destruction wrought on Yemen today, this little-discussed period of Cold War history can tell us a lot about the contemporary Middle East. Today, Yemen is primarily known as home to the world s worst humanitarian crisis, having suffered theloss of almost 400,000 peoplesince the beginning of the nation s latest war in 2015. However, in the spheres of global trade and big business, it represents a geographical location that can be exploited for international shipping and its largely untouched oil and gas reserves. The leadership in Yemen has always been of great importance, especially in the period of the Cold War, during which Western imperialist nations and their reactionary allies on the Arabian Peninsula feared the prospect of any peoples becoming allies with the Soviet Union. To understand North Yemen s revolution of 1962, which later morphed into a brutal civil/proxy war until 1970, we first must understand the divided nations which would later join together and become a united Yemen in 1990. Yemen, meaning south Arabia in Arabic, has historically been a geographically and culturally perspicuous territory. The uppermost region of Yemen, formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire, gained its official independence in 1918, calling itself the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. The kingdom, which was known retrospectively as North Yemen, was controlled by a monarch, Imam Yahya Mohammed, who hailed from the Zaydi-Shia Islamic sect. Meanwhile, the south and east of Yemen lay under the control of the British Empire. Declared the Aden Colony in 1937, the southernmost territory in Yemen was developed around the key port city of Aden, strategically located where the Red Sea meets the Arabian Sea. Aden was first conquered by the British East India Company in 1839 and they ruled their colony with an iron fist. The North Yemeni revolution erupted on September 26, 1962, when a commander of Yemen s Royal Guard, Abdullah al-Sallal, led a number of Egyptian and Iraqi-trained officers in a popular coup d'etat to overthrow Yemen s monarchical leadership. Al-Sallal was inspired by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was the leading voice for Arab nationalism at the time. Al-Sallal s army of revolutionary republicans deposed the newly crowned ruler, Mohammed al-Badr, quickly seizing Yemen s capital city, Sanaa, declaring the newly formed Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). At the time of the revolution in the north, the British governing the colony of Aden began to fear what this could mean for their then-top-secret plan to create the Federation of South Arabia , which they would later form in 1963. The British also feared the security threat such a revolution could pose to its allied regimes in the Persian Gulf, like Bahrain and Oman, where they sought after oil and the stability of the autocratic leaderships they had helped to place in power. The British could not allow an ally of Nasser, who was aligned with the Soviet Union, to become prosperous and spread the ideology of Arab nationalism even further on the Arabian Peninsula. Following the assassination of the Crown Prince of North Yemen, Imam Yahya Mohammed, in 1948, came the consequential era of his son, Imam Ahmed bin Yahya. Imam Ahmed, as he is often referred to, aspired to rule over a Greater Yemen , and his forces clashed on several occasions with the British to the south. In March 1955, Imam Ahmad survived a coup attempt and faced mounting pressure against his autocratic rule. He eventually decided in 1958 to join what became the United Arab States, a confederation with what is now Egypt and Syria, known at the time as the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR, which had unified Syria and Egypt, quickly crumbled, and by 1961, Yemen had officially withdrawn from the confederation. It has been argued that the confederation s breakup was a significant factor in paving the way for the 1962 civil war, as it then gave way to al-Sallal s republicanism, which would become popular in North Yemen. The former King of Yemen, Imam Mohammed al-Badr, did not decide to cede power to his republican opponents without a fight fleeing to Saudi Arabia and from there rallying an army of royalists that were equipped and supplied by Riyadh. I asked Rune Agerhus, the chief coordinator at the Organization of Solidarity with the Yemeni Struggle (OSYS), how the Mutawakkilite Kingdom s leadership was able to suddenly change and ally itself with Saudi Arabia, after formerly being an ally of Nasser. He stated: Up until recently, to rule Yemen meant to balance yourself on the precipice of internal and external contradictions. Yemen has always prided itself on the fact that it had remained an independent kingdom for more than a thousand years up until 1962, with a long anti-colonial history against both the Roman and Ottoman empires. Despite economic and political cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom going as far back as the 1920s, the emerging multipolar world with two competing superpowers on each side meant Imam Al-Badr had to make some significant choices to remain seated in power. The clashes that the Kingdom of Yemen had with Saudi Arabia and British forces to the south were not born out of any anti-colonial sentiment, but rather from the feeling that these two countries held territory that the Imam believed was his. It all changed in 1962 when the very superstructures of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom and the Imam s rule were threatened. There is also the very crucial point to be made that Yemen s tribes have always been influenced by Saudi rule and decree, a malignant practice that has helped shape Yemen as the poorest Arab country on the planet. Saudi Arabia in turn likely promised to support Imam Al-Badr to maintain this tribal influence, and the Imam sought refuge in an unlikely ally to maintain power. Although the US did end up supplying anti-air weapons to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in its fight against the republicans in Yemen, it fell short of playing the role, on the side of the KSA, that it does in today s conflict against the Ansarallah government, which took over Sanaa in 2015. Instead, it was the British that played the most prominent role of any Western country, on the side of the Saudi-backed royalists. MI6, the British SAS special forces, and mercenaries were all used to fight the Arab-nationalist republican forces, led by al-Sallal, in Yemen. Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan also played a prominent role in providing weapons, intelligence, and logistical support to the Saudi-backed royalists. One of the primary reasons for the Saudi-led coalition s backing of the royalists in the conflict was the direct involvement of Egypt on the side of the newly established Yemen Arab Republic. The USSR was the first nation to formally recognize the YAR, and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushcheveven wrote to the Yemeni Republican leader, al-Sallal, stating that any act of aggression against Yemen will be considered an act of aggression against the Soviet Union. Nasser sought to challenge Saudi Arabia, encourage the spread of Arab nationalism, and drive the British out of Yemen in order to bring the Red Sea under Arab sovereignty. Just how pivotal was the influence of external powers on the civil war? Agerhus says: Saudi Arabia is, by many, considered to have been Yemen s sworn enemy ever since thousands of barefooted Yemeni pilgrims were murdered by clansmen led by Al-Saud [Saudi Arabia s ruling family] in the Tanomah valley in 1922. This marked the starting point of the long feud between the two countries. After the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the early 1930s, the Western economic bloc got itself a new ally in the region that it could trust to thwart the emergence of what was then considered radical thought. The build-up of global and regional alliances was already taking shape prior to the revolution of 1962. The Cold War affected the North Yemen civil war because the competing polars had vastly different viewpoints on the rights of people to self-determination and fundamentally different perceptions of the very practice of colonialism and feudalism. Egyptian and Soviet support for Abdullah Al-Sallal's forces shaped the war to a large extent, which is evident even today as the prevailing superstructures of Yemeni society and the armed forces are and were modeled on Egyptian inspiration and armed with Soviet and Russian weaponry. I do believe the war would have been fought otherwise, but perhaps with different results without international support. In Yemen s British-controlled south, 1962 was also the year that pan-Arab liberation movements began to grow in size and put up a fight against British colonial rule. In October 1963, a new revolution began in the south, or what the British would come to describe as the Aden emergency, which involved revolutionary action from a unified front of Marxist and Arab nationalist forces from the Taiz and Aden areas. This revolution was aided by the YAR, as the leading revolutionary forces in British-occupied southern Yemen came together to form the unified Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, which was set up under the supervision of their revolutionary comrades in Yemen s north. I don t believe there is any evidence to suggest that international assistance to the anti-colonial struggle was crucial in shaping the inevitable result, Agerhus says. However, the People s Democratic Republic of Yemen, as an institution, likely would not have been established without Soviet political and advisory support. He went on to say that the struggle in the south was centered on two competing but cooperating resistance factions, the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, or FLOSY for short, and the National Liberation Front. FLOSY maintained a socialist Arab nationalist political line while the NLF ascribed to Marxist ideology. Between 1962 and 1970, at least 200,000 people had been killed in a conflict which eventually led to the inevitable; the Yemen Arab Republic was recognized as a sovereign nation and the royalists, who lacked popular support, were defeated. However, while the republicans had won the war, in the process, so too had Arab nationalism died amid the fighting in Yemen. It is often suggested that the downfall of Arab nationalism stemmed from the shocking defeat of Nasser s Egypt during the June 1967 war, when Israel launched its offensive known as Operation Focus and went on to defeat its Arab neighbors in only six days. However, without Egypt s over-commitment to the war in Yemen, which had reached a deadly stalemate during the mid-1960s, Tel Aviv may not have possessed the confidence to have launched the Six-Day War, or at the very least Egypt would have been more prepared for the confrontation. The war in Yemen cost the Egyptians so dearly that it is often referred to as Egypt s Vietnam, a war in which Nasser s army was so heavily bogged down that his home turf ended up occupied by Israel. In 1967, as Nasser s Arab nationalism was dealt a death blow, an alternative ideology emerged which the Arab world would harness to continue its fight against imperialist powers and autocratic Middle Eastern rulers. Marxist ideology, in its various forms, was the natural answer to fill the ideological void. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in Yemen; in November 1967, the Yemeni revolution in the nation s south proved successful in forcing out the British colonialists and the revolutionary forces declared the sovereignty of South Yemen. The defeat of Egypt earlier that June had seen the Israelis seize the Sinai Peninsula, resulting in the closure of the Suez Canal supply route for the next eight years. The closure of this strategic supply route to Europe, combined with the pressure of the ongoing revolutionary war, forced the British to leave and, only two years later, after the liberation of South Yemen, the Arab world s first communist state was declared in 1969, the People s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). I do believe that the Cold War ended up having a positive effect on Yemen s domestic political trends, Agerhus said when asked about the era s impact. He explained that the majority of Yemen s population are peasantry, and the country has a rich and diverse political landscape with left-leaning and Islamically progressive tendencies dominating the scene. The general population also remains vocally anti-colonialist in both tone, theory and practice, which is undoubtedly a relic that persists from the Cold War. Although the Cold War provided inspiration and an environment in which Yemenis would rise up against the tyranny of their British occupiers to the south and an autocratic regime to the north, with the decline of the Soviet Union, the lack of any solid counterbalance to Western hegemony doomed the nation. Initially, unification was thought to lead to a brighter future for Yemen as a whole, one under which the leaderships of both South and North Yemen could co-exist. However, the eventual unification of the PDRY (South Yemen) with the YAR (North Yemen), birthing the Republic of Yemen in 1990, only ended up landing the country back in the hands of an autocratic ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who would advocate and implement neo-liberal economic policies that crippled the public sector, all to appease international monetary institutions. It has been speculated that, due to the loss of Soviet support for the PDRY and the weakness of both the economies of South and North Yemen, this was a primary factor in unification; however, when I asked Agerhus this question, he answered with the following: I don t believe it was a significant factor, considering that unification was already under consideration by the late 1960s. Yemen was never meant to be separated. Representatives of South Yemeni trade unionists had seats in the government of North Yemen during the Civil War. A unified socialist state was always the penultimate goal, but ideological and geopolitical complications made the achievement of unification a prolonged and complicated matter. Yemen had earlier than 1990 been close to unification. In the 1970s, North Yemen was ruled by socialist military leader Ibrahim Al-Hamdi, who sought to improve and reshape society natively without any external intervention. Although an Arab nationalist by heart, he was still left-leaning enough to find large common ground with South Yemen s president, Salim Rubai Ali, to such an extent that by 1977, a shared elementary school curriculum had been enacted to be taught in both Yemeni nation states, and with plans to reunify the two states diplomatic corps. A scheduled visit to Aden in 1977 would likely have further solidified the course towards actual reunification, but was forced to a halt with Al-Hamdi murdered during a luncheonby his right-hand man, Al-Ghashmi, on October 11, a murder many consider Saudi Arabia to have orchestrated in order to regain control of the tribes, whose influence Hamdi had made great effort to curb and limit. The Yemen we see today is a nation that was under the thumb of an autocratic ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, for 33 years, a country that s direction was left in the hands of Western powers following the Cold War. On the results of 1962-1970 conflict, Agerhus says: The civil war and consequential atrophy of the public administration meant that Yemen was beyond vulnerable and even poorer than it had ever been. In theory, the September 26 revolution was a milestone achievement for Yemeni society, seeing the establishment of the Peninsula s only Republic. In theory, the revolution would have established an Arab nationalist democratic state, but in practice, reality turned out to be different. Saudi Arabia maintained its influence on the tribes, and at one point even decided on the appointment of the country s prime minister. This level of influence only grew stronger with Judge Al-Eriyani s presidential term from 1967 until 1974, which saw the establishment of a special ministry of tribal affairs acting as a gateway for further Saudi entrenchment into Yemen s public administration and society.

"25 Sep, 2022",EU farmers warn of food shortages Reuters,"Spiraling energy and fertilizer costs are threatening vegetable and fruit production Vegetable producers across northern and western Europe are considering halting operations, thus further threatening food supplies, as a result of the energy crisis hitting the continent, Reuters reported this week. According to the report, skyrocketing power and gas prices are the biggest cost facing vegetable farmers employing greenhouse cultivation. Two French farmers renewing their electricity contracts for 2023 told the media outlet they were being quoted prices more than ten times higher than in 2021. In the coming weeks I will plan the season but I don't know what to do, said Benjamin Simonot-De Vos, who grows cucumbers, tomatoes and strawberries south of Paris. If it stays like this there's no point starting another year. It s not sustainable. Johannes Gross, deputy sales manager at the German cooperative Reichenau-Gemuse, told Reuters: We face an overall increased production cost of around 30%. Some colleagues are thinking about leaving their greenhouses empty to keep the costs as low as possible. Nobody knows what will happen next year. The soaring costs of fertilizer, packaging and transport have also been adding to the pain. Even in countries with abundant sun, such as Spain, fruit and vegetable farmers are grappling with a 25% jump in fertilizer costs. As farmers across the EU warn of shortages, supermarkets may switch to sourcing more goods from warmer countries such as Morocco, Turkey, Tunisia, and Egypt, the report says.

The remark came after the summit of the group wrapped up in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Erdogan took part in this year s event as a special guest. Our relations with these countries will be moved to a much different position with this step, Erdogan told reporters on board his plane. Asked whether Turkey is seeking to formally join the group, the president responded affirmatively. Of course, that's the goal, he said.

"15 Sep, 2022",Moscow responds to UN resolution on nuclear plant,"Shelling by Kiev s forces was not even mentioned, Russian diplomats point out Russia has criticized the resolution adopted by the UN nuclear watchdog on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. The document passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is anti-Russian and does not say a single word about the Ukrainian shelling of the facility, Russian diplomats have said. The facility, the largest of its kind in Europe, is located in Ukraine but currently controlled by Russian forces. On Thursday, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a document demanding Russia immediately cease all actions against, and at, the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. The text also said the board deplores the Russian Federation s persistent violent actions against nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Russia s mission to the IAEA responded by saying that the document was pushed through by the West, while the majority of humanity refused to support it. The resolution passed with 26 votes in favor. Russia and China, which are also on the board, voted against it, while seven nations Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Burundi, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan abstained. Those supporting the document mostly consisted of the US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere. The Russian diplomats also blasted the fact that the resolution fails to mention the shelling of the station, the evidence for which Moscow had provided several times. The officials also accused Western nations of supporting and shielding Kiev in every possible way, while blaming Ukraine for the attacks. The document was passed in the wake of the IAEA mission that visited the Zaporozhye plant in early September. On Wednesday, in a phone call with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the IAEA's work, which is contributing to the safety of the facility. This was the second resolution adopted by the IAEA amid the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The first one was passed in March before Russian forces had taken control of the power plant. The documents are similar in nature and in both cases were introduced by Canada and Poland on behalf of Ukraine, which is not on the agency s board, according to Reuters. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the grounds of the plant. Kiev has denied the accusations and instead blamed Russia for the incidents, despite the area already being under Moscow s control.

According to Peskov all relations in the SCO are built on the basis of mutual respect for each other s interests and mutual benefit. No one sets the goal of making the SCO an alternative to a military organization. This is friendship in the name of something, not against someone, he said. In the wake of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, relations between Moscow and the West are at an all-time low. As NATO continues to expand and its members impose economic sanctions on Russia, Moscow insists that any attempts to isolate the country will fail. The key organizations that Russia is a part of, such as the BRICS and SCO, are also expanding. Iran and Argentina officially applied for BRICS membership in late June, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt have shown interest in joining the bloc. Ahead of the summit in Samarkand, SCO Secretary General Zhang Ming said the suggestion that there is a long queue outside the door to the organization is not an exaggeration. On Thursday, the SCO signed a protocol with Iran which paves the way for the country s full accession. The SCO encompasses 40% of the world s population, and more than 30% of global GDP.

The Middle-Eastern nation, which the US has long sought to undermine with diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions, made a formal step on Thursday to become the ninth member of the organization. Among the SCO s heavyweights are Russia and China, two major powers that are on Washington s list of geopolitical opponents. The SCO was created in 2001 as an intragovernmental forum aimed at fostering trust and developing economic and humanitarian ties in Asia. It currently has eight permanent members: China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The last is currently hosting the annual summit of the leaders of the member states in the city of Samarkand. Iran has been an SCO observer since 2005. Its delegation to the summit is headed by President Ebrahim Raisi, who met with senior Uzbek officials on Wednesday. The memorandum, which spells the commitments that Tehran will undertake to become an SCO member, was signed by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and SCO Secretary-General Zhang Ming, the host country's foreign ministry reported. Yury Ushakov, a foreign affairs advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said earlier this week that Iran could qualify for being upgraded to full membership before next year s SCO summit in India. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev touted this year s event as a turning point for the organization. He cited the rapidly growing interest of nations in closer involvement with the SCO and said that it served as an example of how a deep crisis of trust at the global level can be overcome by parties willing to do so. He also stressed the scale of the group, which accounts for roughly half of the world s population and a quarter of global GDP. Belarus, also an SCO observer, is set to start the formal process for full membership this year. Egypt and Qatar formally joined the organization as dialogue partners on Wednesday.

American Boehly led a consortium that bought the West London club from former owner Roman Abramovich in a £4.5 billion ($5.2 billion) deal in late May, but has already been criticized by Manchester United icon Gary Neville for his seemingly scattergun approach in the summer transfer window, as well as attracting a rebuke from the likes of Liverpool legend Graeme Souness forsacking manager Thomas Tucheljust weeks into the new season. At the 'Salt' conference in his homeland on Tuesday, Boehly again raised eyebrows by proposing a new match for the English top flight. ""People are talking about why don t we have more money for the [football] pyramid? MLB [Major League Baseball] did their All-Star game this year,""the part-LA Dodgers owner explained. ""They made $200m from a Monday and a Tuesday, you could do a North vs South All-Star game from the Premier League to fund the pyramid very easily,""Boehly suggested.

""Oh great! When he finds a date for that he can call me!

"11 Sep, 2022",The West is poised to throw Yemen under the bus again to fuel its economic war on Russia,"France is ready to destroy the country s ceasefire in bid to secure energy Strained by the consequences of the ongoing conflict between NATO and Russia over Ukraine, France may be destroying all prospects for peace in Yemen, in a bid to secure energy resource from the United Arab Emirates. Considered to be home to the worst humanitarian crisis in modern history, according to the United Nations, earlier this year, its people saw glimmers of hope towards ending its seven-year long war. A ceasefire truce, which has largely heldsince April, has been viewed as the first step towards reaching a UN-mediated solution for peace between the Ansarallah government in Sanaa and the Saudi-led coalition forces which claim to represent the internationally backed Yemeni government in exile. According to UN estimates, the total number of people killed in Yemen s war already reached377,000by the beginning of 2022. The civilian death rate issaidto have doubled, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), since the controversial withdrawal of UN human rights monitors last October. Although Saudi coalition forces and Ansarallah, popularly referred to in Western media as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, have managed to keep fighting to a minimum during the past months, another major player in the south of Yemen has recently decided to go on the offensive. The Southern Transitional Council (STC), often called Yemen s southern separatists, are backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and declared the start of a new military operation in the Abyan province to cleanse it of terrorist organisations. This follows territorial gains by the STC, in neighboring Shawba province, against the Muslim Brotherhood aligned Islah Party and others. The offensives launched by the UAE-backed STC have been regarded as a major challenge to UN efforts to end the conflict in Yemen, as well as having imperiled the Saudi initiative, which it calls the Yemen Presidential Council, aimed at solidifying the legitimacy of the alternative Yemeni leadership in exile. Although its role is little known to the Western public, Paris is thethird largest arms supplierto the UAE and Saudi Arabia for their war efforts in Yemen, ranking just behind the US and UK. In fact, Germany, Spain and Italy have also sold weapons that have been used in the devastating war. Despite criticism, from human rights groups, of French weapons being used by Abu Dhabi and Riyadh to commit war crimes, the sale of weaponshas continued from France. April 15, 2019, French investigative magazine, Disclose,published an exposeon Paris s role in Yemen s war. The information presented was based on a leaked French Military Intelligence (DRM) report dating back to September, 2018, clearly proving that the country had sold offensive weapons that were used in civilian areas, a charge that the French government has denied. As far back as June, 2018, credible reports began to emerge that French special forces unitswere operatingon the ground in Yemen, alongside forces belonging to the UAE. Last December, Paris decided to further tighten its relationship with Abu Dhabi, signing its largest ever weapons sale to the UAE,worth 19.23 billion US dollarsaccording to a report from Reuters. France is now desperately in need of alternative energy suppliers to Russia, in order to meet its required needs, fearing that as the winter hits, Moscow may strategically cut off its natural gas completely. As part of NATO, Paris is backing a US-led initiative which seeks to make Russia pay an economic and military price for its offensive in Ukraine, however, this strategy has majorly backfired economically. US President Joe Biden made two major foreign policy pledges when running for office in 2020, which are relevant to the current French predicament. The first being to revive the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal and the second being to find a diplomatic solution to the war in Yemen. Due to the ongoing NATO-Russia conflict, seeking a revival of the Iran nuclear deal has re-emerged on the political agenda of the his administration in a major way. Iran, free from sanctions, could become an alternative source to fill the energy needs of Europe in the future, yet it could take some time for this to actually happen. On the issue of the war in Yemen, Joe Bidenpledgedas part of his first speech on his government's foreign policy goals, that he would hold Saudi Arabia to account and seek to find a solution to the crisis in Yemen. However, the war in Ukraine clearly changed his approach to Riyadh, so much so that Washington signaled ithereview a decisionto not sell offensive weapons to the Saudi government. The US President was heavilycriticizedby Human Rights Watch for traveling to Saudi Arabia in July. Despite US attempts to have Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states increase their oil production, none have yet complied in the manner that Washington had hoped for. Specifically in the cases of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, it is clear that both are seeking to fast track their journey to diversify their economies. That has meant them hanging onto their strategic reserves of oil and gas, during a global energy crisis, which has made fiscal sense for them. In the cases of Venezuela and Iran, despite the US having seemingly reached out to both, neither seem to be a real replacement to Russia in the near future. France is now looking for alternatives on its own. In June, the European Union announced that it hadsignedan agreement with Israel and Egypt. Under the deal, Israel will send gas through pipelines to Egypt, where it will then be transported to Europe. Although this may work, Tel Aviv does not have the capacity to replace Moscow as Europe s main supplier of gas. Israelseeksto double its gas output, but in doing so is already running into potential problems over its maritime border dispute with Lebanon and its planned extraction of gas from the Karish field in September, considered to be located in a disputed area. Lebanese Hezbollah has eventhreatenedto strike all of Israel s gas facilities in the event that Beirut is not given a fair deal to access its own resources. French President, Emmanuel Macron, has attempted to persuade resource rich Algeria to become part of the EU s solution, also going on a three-day trip to Algiers in order to mend ties. Algeria, which maintains close relations with Moscow, withdrew its ambassador from Paris for three months last year, during a diplomatic row. Macronhad accusedthe Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune s government of exploiting memory and rewriting history of the colonial era and even questioned the legitimacy of Algeria as a State prior to French settler-colonial rule there. Around1.5 million Algerians were killedin the battle for independence from France, which its resistance eventually managed to win in 1962. The tone of the French president has now dramatically changed from that of last year, withMacron remarkingthat both nations have a complex, painful common past. And it has at times prevented us from looking at the future. The other major alternative path that France seems to be now seeking, is through its close alliance with the UAE. As mentioned above, it has been clear for some time that Paris has been involved in supplying weapons, logistical support and even boots on the ground to its allies in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, aiding their fight in Yemen. However, it is also clear that the UAE has not been interested in cutting into its strategic oil reserves to meet the demands of Europe. In July, as President Macron hosted the Emirati President, Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, in Paris, the French ministry of economyannounceda new strategic energy agreement between the UAE and France. An aide to the French president noted that France was eager tosecurediesel fuel from the UAE, hinting that the cooperation agreement involving France s Total Energies and the UAE s ADNOC may be linked. Although it is unknown as to what the specifics of the strategic agreement are, it has been speculated that the deal could potentially be worth billions. Then, in August, the UAE-backed STC suddenly began new offensive operations in both the Shabwa and Abyan provinces. It just so happens that the STC forces decided totake overthe energy sites in the Shabwa province too. Leading human rights NGOshad urgedParis to keep in mind Abu Dhabi's human rights abuses in the advent of the signing of the strategic energy agreement, calls clearly not heeded. On August 21st, when UAE-backed forcesseizedthe oil facilities in Yemen s south, it may have been with the French deal in mind. Yemen s former foreign minister, Dr. Abu Bakr al-Qirbistated on Twitterthat preparations are being made to export gas from the Balhaf facility in light of increased international gas prices. This was then followed by an announcement from the parliament of the Sana a-based National Salvation Government,warningof suspicious movement from both US and French forces. The key Balhaf facility, in Yemen s Shabwa province, has reportedly beenturned intoa base for forces belonging to the UAE, with allegations suggesting that Paris could provide protection for the facility through the French Foreign Legion."" There are also countless reports of the UAE looting resources from Yemen, which would seem to support the idea that they could be attempting to extract them to send to France. The latest reported looting of Yemen s resources, from June, quotes Yemeni officials as having alleged that a Gulf Aetos tanker, carrying400,000 barrels of Yemeni crude oil, had departed from Rudum port and was being operated by the UAE. What these offensive moves by the STC also mean, is that the Saudi-backed forces in Yemen and Ansarallah will likely also get involved in the combat too. This could mean thedissolutionof the ceasefire truce between the two sides, the renewal of the Ansarallah offensive to take the oil rich Marib province from the Saudi-backed forces and the death of any potential peace initiative to end the war. It is unlikely that Ansarallah will stay silent, if the STC are aiding in the theft of Yemen s resources for the sake of France. One of the major reasons behind the dramatic escalation of violence last year, was the Ansarallah offensive, launched with the aim of taking out the last northern stronghold of the Saudi-led coalition, Marib. The purpose of taking the resource rich area would be to stop the looting of Yemen s resources, which according to reports is amounting to the theft ofmillions of barrels per year. Some sources claim that an unofficialagreementis in place between the US and Saudi governments, to purposefully keep the resources of Yemen away from its people and instead, divert the profits to Saudi banks. Part of the reason why there was a Yemeni revolution in 2011, then a seizure of power in 2015 by Ansarallah in conjunction with the country s military, wasthe popular beliefthat the past two Presidents of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh and Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, were corrupt. The people of Yemen were fed up with Saleh for a multitude of reasons, primarily that he mismanaged resources, had sold out to the United States and was corrupt. President Hadi was later to be seen as a stooge, controlled completely by the Saudis. Perhaps the biggest problem here however, is not just that Yemen is a resource rich country, with a starving population, being torn apart by foreign powers, but also that nobody even knows what their governments are involved in. On August 25, then British prime minister, Boris Johnson, stated, aboutrisingenergy bills, that While people are paying energy bills, people in Ukraine are paying with blood . Yet, it may turn out that for Europe to keep the lights on, the people of Yemen will pay with their blood. Except in this case, the UK, US and France can t blame that bloodshed on Moscow, this is their own doing.

"7 Sep, 2022",Petr Akopov: Russia and China s growing partnership with the Islamic world spells trouble for the West,"The traditional Anglo-American strategy of playing divide and conquer with Muslim states may have run its course ByPetr Akopov,RIA Novosti With Covid quarantines no longer a hindrance, summits have returned to the diplomatic agenda. First, the West returned to face-to-face meetings EU and NATO summits have been taking place for some time now and now it is the turn of the East. Top Asian leaders have not met collectively for more than three years, but in a week s time the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) will gather in the Uzbek city of Samarkand and will bring together all its leaders. Until recently, it was not entirely clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be coming, as some observers had assumed he would not leave Beijing before the Communist Party congress in mid-October. But it has since been announced that the Chinese leader will visit Kazakhstan next week, so a trip to Uzbekistan is also a foregone conclusion. The meeting between Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will be the second this year, but the first since the start of the military operation in Ukraine. Also, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet for the first time ever in Samarkand. For the two neighbors with a history of fraught relations, the SCO is becoming an important platform for dialogue. And the SCO itself is rapidly outgrowing its original format as a Russo-Chinese security alliance in Central Asia and involving just the Central Asian republics. The group now boasts four nuclear states that is, virtually all of the non-Western members of the club (except North Korea). In Uzbekistan, the SCO eight will turn into a nine as the procedure for Iran's accession will be completed. However, the organization will not be limited to that number for long it has already announced its intention to start the procedure to transfer Belarus from an observer to a full-fledged member. And it will not stop there. Several more countries, including some influential ones, want to join the SCO. In recent years, there have been four observers to the organization (as candidates for membership), but now Tehran has come on board and Belarus is starting the transition procedure, so that leaves Afghanistan and Mongolia. Whereas previously the main obstacle to Kabul s inclusion was the presence of US troops in the country, this problem no longer exists, so its acceptance into the SCO will undoubtedly occur. This will not happen immediately, but rather once the situation in the country has stabilized and a full-fledged system of governance and law and order have been established (naturally, with the help of SCO countries). Mongolia could become a full-fledged participant at any time none of the member states have any objections but in the past it has been slow to do so, preferring to remain an observer. However, rising global tensions will also affect Ulaanbaatar's position, while the growing queue of aspiring SCO members may also prompt its leadership to step up. There had been aspirants to join the SCO before, but this year they have moved from words to deeds. And we are not only talking about the countries that were among the 'partners in dialogue' (another format of interaction). These aspirants comprise nine states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. The last three obtained the status of dialogues partners only a year ago but are already looking to upgrade to being able to join the organization in full. Syria and Myanmar also want to be involved, along with the United Arab Emirates, which seeks immediate accession. Although such a request cannot be granted, it is in itself a sign of the rapidly growing interest in the organization, which is driven by the Sino-Russian partnership. The reasons for this are clear: although the consolidation of the non-Western world has been steadily gaining momentum over the past decade, things have accelerated since the beginning of 2020. First, Covid and the resulting lockdowns led to a crisis of globalization, then the operation in Ukraine forced the West to insist that whoever does not go along with the blockade of Russia is for Putin. And then the provocation of the Taiwan issue hurt the prospects for normalizing relations between the West and the Middle Kingdom. The whole world is being forced to pick a side. Under these conditions, the optimal model for many influential countries in the Islamic world is to demonstrate their independence, which is seen as carving out a position equidistant from the two poles, i.e. Russia-China and the United States-EU. But how can US military allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia find this equidistance? By joining the SCO. While it is true that the SCO is not a military bloc, belonging to the organization clearly indicates an unwillingness to participate in any Western anti-Russian and anti-Chinese efforts. That is why Recep Erdogan will fly to Samarkand, and possibly Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well. In this case, the SCO nine will turn, albeit unofficially so far, into a club of 11, that is, a platform where Russia, China, India and the four most important countries of the Islamic world meet: Saudi Arabia, the richest and most influential ; Iran, the oldest and most passionate ; Turkey, the most developed and ambitious ; and Pakistan, the only nuclear one . The SCO observers also include Egypt, the main country in the Arab world ; and Qatar, the information and propaganda giant . These Islamic countries admittedly do not have the smoothest relations among themselves (especially Saudi Arabia and Iran), and in the past the West has actively used their discord. Russia and China, however, are not interested in pitting Muslims against each other but in involving them in building a new, post-Western world order. And if the three great powers Russia, China, and India manage to build strategic relations with the Islamic world in working out a new world order, it will be tantamount to a final verdict in the Anglo-Saxon bid for global domination. The Atlanticists are no longer betting on a quarrel between Russia and China but on pitting India and China against each other. And they are virtually certain that they will be able to keep the Islamic world in their orbit (and even use it against Beijing and Moscow). Therefore, the Islamization of the SCO will be the most important challenge to the Anglo-Saxon project and also a sign of its complete collapse.",https://www.rt.com/russia/562371-russia-china-growing-partnership/
"30 Aug, 2022",Dmitry Trenin: This Russia-China founded bloc represents half the world s population and will help forge the new world order,"The international system is going through a deep crisis and the group is poised to achieve greater relevance Dmitry Treninis a Research Professor at the Higher School of Economics and a Lead Research Fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations. He is also a member of the Russian International Affairs Council. Over 20 years after it began as an attempt at cooperation between five-Russian led post-Soviet states and an emerging China, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has become a major global institution, representing close to half of the world s population. From September 15-16, Samarkand, one of the ancient centers of human civilization, will host the annual summit of the group. The Uzbek presidency s priorities include strengthening the SCO s capabilities in assuring regional security and stability; promoting friendship and good-neighborliness; raising its global profile; countering threats in the information and ideological spheres; expanding parliamentary links; energizing economic interaction; enhancing connectivity; intensifying cultural and humanitarian contacts; and raising the general effectiveness of the collective and its mechanisms. All of this looks impressive, but quite anodyne, and the documents to be formally approved at the summit do not promise any major sensations beyond the long-expected admission of Iran as the SCO s ninth member state. Yet the environment in which the Samarkand summit will be held differs greatly even from last year s gathering in Dushanbe. Russia s military operation in Ukraine has led to a proxy war between Moscow and Washington. Meanwhile, Sino-US relations, already confrontational, have become palpably strained over the recent visit to Taiwan by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. NATO s new strategic concept adopted last June in Madrid describes Russia as the most significant and direct threat, and China for the first time as a challenge to Western interests, security and values. As a result, the international community has moved visibly closer to a Cold War-style division between two camps in an intensifying rivalry over the world order. That said, the SCO is unlikely to become the non-West s version of NATO. While the US-led bloc is now more united than ever in its effort to preserve the order built and developed in the heyday of its global dominance, non-Western nations do not display anything similar to that sort of unity, hierarchy, and internal discipline. Russia and China, although they both reject US global hegemony, pursue very different grand strategies and despite their public declarations of a cooperation that knows no limits, and a partnership that is more than an alliance are careful not to damage their other important connections e.g., China s with the US and EU; and Russia s with India as they cooperate with each other. Moreover, China and India, not to mention the latter and Pakistan, while all members of the SCO, view each other as major security threats. Despite such diversity and complexity, however, the SCO, at the start of its third decade, is not only still in business, but is steadily getting more active and becoming more attractive to others. In 2001, it started at six; after 2017, the membership expanded to eight, with another 20 countries or so listed as observers, dialogue partners, or in the process of joining. Iran s accession this year is spurring the interest of Turkey and a number of Arab countries, notably the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Qatar. The SCO community could potentially include much of the Eurasian continent between Belarus and Cambodia. Such enlargement carries obvious risks in terms of even wider diversity of interest, conflict, and frictions between the countries that aspire to join. Yet, the example of China and Russia; India and Pakistan finding the SCO useful to their interests is a convincing argument for accession. In fact, the SCO s lack of a single leader; its consensus-based decision-making procedures; its emphasis on national sovereignty and non-interference is a welcome contrast to the US-dominated NATO or like-minded groups such as the G7. Being in the SCO does not mean following Beijing s or Moscow s guidance. So far, so good. Yet, to flip the coin, what can the SCO actually give its members, observers, and partners? The general answer is: security in their mutual relations and stability across the continent. The organization, after all, originated from talks on border and military security issues between China on the one hand, and Russia and the Central Asian states on the other. Membership itself does not guarantee that there will be no conflicts, but it provides for means to prevent or manage them. Thus, it provides a unique platform for regular high-level and top-level contacts between Delhi and Beijing. Anti-terrorist cooperation for all the differences in defining terrorism is another obvious bonus. After last year s US withdrawal from Afghanistan, SCO member states have stepped up their efforts to bolster stability in the region. Economic development has long featured as one of the key areas of SCO cooperation. China s Belt and Road Initiative has been followed by the North-South corridor linking Russia, Iran, the Arab countries, and India. Peace in the South Caucasus could be cemented by restoring connectivity within the region and its links to the north and the south. The unraveling of Chimerica and the EU-Russia decoupling in the wake of the Ukraine war signal the replacement of globalization with regionalization. Asian and Eurasian countries which for the past couple of centuries were much more closely involved with distant Western powers than with their own neighbors are now focusing on opportunities in their dynamic neighborhood. Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia are also opening doors much wider to Asian and Middle Eastern investment in Russia and trade with it. A new impetus for Eurasian interaction has been created in the post-Ukraine environment by the seizure by the West of half of Russia s currency reserves. The central issue that has entered a number of countries strategic calculus is the reliability of the US dollar-based global financial system. Increasingly, national currencies of the SCO member states and observers, such as the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee, the Turkish lira, the Iranian riel, as well as the Russian ruble are being used in trade between these countries. In parallel, national payment systems of these and other countries are becoming connected, allowing them to conduct transactions directly, rather than via Washington or its allies. At this point, the mechanisms are still cumbersome, but therein lies the beginning of a new international financial system which is free from diktat by a hegemonic outside power. The sanctions imposed on Iran, and now on Russia, could in the future be slapped on other nations that find themselves in conflict with the US. The international system as it emerged from the end of the Cold War is going through a deep crisis which will take a long time to resolve. The present system is founded on organizations either rooted in or inspired by the Cold War like NATO or AUKUS, or heavily dominated by Western powers, like the international financial institutions, the OSCE, and the UN system as a whole. It is doubtful that the prime beneficiaries of the existing situation will do more than budge a little to make room for emerging players; they will certainly do their best to retain control over the system that they have devised and operated. While the future of the world order is being decided in the ongoing major power competition, a practical way of altering the situation to better serve the interests of the growing number of autonomous players is through developing organizations such as the SCO independent, non-hegemonic, and inclusive. Potentially, the SCO could become a model for the 21st century order in the world s most important regional space.

"26 Aug, 2022",South Korea seals nuclear deal with Russia,"Seoul insists the agreement doesn t contradict US sanctions policy South Korea has clinched a 3 trillion won ($2.25 billion) deal with Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom to provide components and construct turbine buildings for Egypt s first nuclear power plant, Korean officials said on Thursday. According to an Energy Ministry statement, the state-owned Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power has won a contract to supply materials and equipment for Egypt s El Dabaa project. Last month, Rosatom launched construction work in the Egyptian coastal town of Dabaa, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Cairo. The facility is expected to include four reactors with capacity of 1.2 gigwatts each. The South Korean firm was subcontracted by Russia s Atomstroyexport, Rosatom s unit, to supply certain materials and equipment, as well as to build turbine buildings and other structures at the site. Officials from South Korea s Presidential Office and Trade Ministry said Washington was consulted in advance about the contract to be sure that the technologies being provided by Seoul would not violate US sanctions against Russia. Rosatom, one of the world leaders in the nuclear industry, is one of the few Russian state-controlled majors not subject to Western sanctions.

"24 Aug, 2022",World Cup host Qatar arrests workers after protests AP,"The Gulf state is preparing for this winter's controversial event FIFA World Cup host Qatar arrested at least 60 foreign workers that were protesting late pay and also deported some of them, according to an advocacy group. Qatar has faced international scrutiny over its labor practices since being named the host of the international football tournament, and like many other Gulf Arab countries, relies heavily on foreign laborers from countries such as India and the Philippines. Video footage shared online shows around 60 workers angrily protesting having gone as many as seven months without pay outside the Al Bandary International Group's Doha offices on August 14. The Al Bandary International Group is a conglomerate that includes construction, hotel, real estate, and food service ventures among others under its umbrella. And while it hasn't responded to arequestfrom the Associated Press to comment on the matter, the Qatari government has acknowledged that the company hadn't paid the workers their salaries and promised that the country's Labor Ministry would pay""all delayed salaries and benefits."" ""The company was already under investigation by the authorities for nonpayment of wages before the incident, and now further action is being taken after a deadline to settle outstanding salary payments was missed,""the government added, while also saying that a number of protesters were""detained for breaching public safety laws""to the AP. Reacting to the developments, the executive director of human and labor rights group Equidem, Mustafa Qadri, asked:""Is this really the reality coming out?"" After they blocked an intersection in front of Doha's Shoumoukh Tower on the city's C Ring Road, the protesters were arrested and then held in a detention center in intense heat without air conditioning according to accounts relayed to Qadri. As Doha s temperature reached around 41 degrees Celsius last week, Qadri said that police told those apprehended that if they can strike in hot weather, they can also sleep without air conditioning. In uncorroborated comments, one detained worker explained to Equidem that he had seen up to 300 colleagues at the detention centers from countries such as India, the Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh and Egypt with some of them paid salaries after the protest and others not. Past protests have seen some foreign workers deported, with their employment contracts often tied to residency visas and the right to form unions limited only to Qataris. Qatar has made some progress in improving employment practices since being awarded the right to host FIFA's showpiece tournament in 2010. Adopting a minimum wage of $275 for workers and making sure they have food and housing allowances, the country has also eliminated its 'kafala' system that tied workers to employers given the final word in whether they could leave their jobs and in some cases, Qatar itself. Qadri is among the prominent voices that have pushed authorities in Doha to do more for workers and posed:""Have we all been duped by Qatar over the last several years?"" Qadri claimed that recent reforms might have provided""cover""for the Qatari government to allow common practices to continue. Against this backdrop of controversy coupled with other hot topics such as migrant deaths and the treatment of the LGBTQ community, the World Cup is set to get underway on November 20.

Daniel Kovalikteaches International Human Rights at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, and is author of the recently-released book Nicaragua: A History of US Intervention & Resistance. There is an old joke which still has resonance. A child asks his parent, Why are there pyramids in Egypt? The parent answers, Because they were too big to take to Britain. Of course, many a true word is spoken in jest. Indeed, there is an apocryphal story that back in the day when Vladimir Lenin was in exile in London, he would enjoy taking friends to the British Museum and explaining to them how and from what far-flung lands all the antiquities there were stolen. One might have thought that these days of colonial plunder had ended, but one would be very wrong. Current examples abound. A notable one is, of course, thefreezing by the US of $7 billionfrom the Afghanistan treasury monies the US continues to hold even as it watches Afghans begin to die from starvation. Apparently, the US believes that, after laying waste to Afghanistan through 20 years of war and, even before that by supporting the mujahideen terrorists, it is entitled to some compensation. This upside-down type of reasoning abounds in the minds of those in the West who simply believe they can take whatever they wish. Similarly, the US is now plundering Syria another country utterly devastated in no small part by Washington-backed militants in a campaign to overthrow the elected president of most of its oil, even as Syria suffers from severe energy blackouts. Thus,according to the Syrian Oil Ministry, US occupation forces and their mercenaries, referring to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), steal up to 66,000 barrels every single day from the fields occupied in the eastern region, amounting to around 83% of Syria s daily oil production. According to the ministry s data, the Syrian oil sector has incurred losses of about $105 billion since the beginning of the war until the middle of this year as a result of the US oil theft campaign. Additionally, the statement added that alongside the financial losses incurred by the oil sector were losses of life, including 235 martyrs, 46 injured and 112 kidnapped. One of the biggest heists the US has carried out is against Russia. After the launch of Russia s military operation in Ukraine, the USseized an incredible $300 billionof Russian treasury funds which were deposited abroad. This was done, of course, without any due process, and to the great detriment of the Russian people and with barely a critical word from Western pundits. The US treatment of Venezuela abounds with other examples. As I write these words, the US is maneuvering toseize a commercial 747 airlinerfrom Venezuela on the grounds that it once belonged to an Iranian airline which had some connection to Iran s Revolutionary Guard Corps (which Washington has designated as terrorists) which might sound like a tenuous justification, but the US really needs no reason. And this is simply the tip of the iceberg. The US has already seized Venezuela s biggest single source of revenue its US-based oil company CITGO and is nowin the process of selling off this companyin pieces, even as Washington lifts restrictions on Venezuelan oil to shore up its own economy. The UK, meanwhile, hasdecided to keep over $1 billion in goldwhich Venezuela naively deposited in the Bank of England for safe-keeping. To add insult to injury, the US continues to criticize Venezuela for the hardships its people endure as a direct consequence of this plunder. Meanwhile, the US continues to persecute Colombian businessman Alex Saab fortrying to obtain food and medicine for the Venezuelan people, denied such amenities by US sanctions. Saab was captured at the behest of the US in Cabo Verde in 2020 as he wasflying to Iran to negotiate a dealfor humanitarian supplies, including medicine to confront the coronavirus pandemic, on a mission he was employed to perform by Caracas. Saab has since been removed to a federal prison in Miami, Florida, despite the lack of an extradition treaty between the US and Cabo Verde, and he continues to languish in prison as the wheels of US 'justice' turn at a snail s pace to resolve his case. In short, not only has the US freely stolen from Venezuela, but it is also going to great lengths to stop those who try to acquire the basic necessities for the Venezuelan people. All of this illustrates that colonial habits die hard, and the US is always ready to turn to the tried and trusted traditions of plunder whether to dig itself out of one of the worst economic crises in years, or to coerce other nations to serve its own geopolitical interests. The fact that the US is allowed to get away with this demonstrates that in the Washington-imposed 'rules-based order' rule of law is nothing but a tool employed by the mighty to keep the weak down.",https://www.rt.com/news/561171-us-uk-empires-stealing/
"20 Aug, 2022",Massive fire consumes mall in Mediterranean port city (VIDEOS),"A faulty air conditioner was to blame for the blaze in Alexandria, officials said A shopping mall in Alexandria, Egypt was gutted by fire on Saturday, with smoke spewing out of the building and towering over the coastal city. The devastation, which officials blamed on an air conditioning unit, was captured on video. The blaze began in a recreational area of the City Center Alexandria mall before spreading to other parts of the building, Erem News reported. Video footage shot from the mall s parking lot showed the building s roof on fire, as smoke poured into the sky. Egypt s interior ministry added shortly afterwards that the fire had been contained with no loss of life. An examination found that an air conditioning unit on the roof of the building was the source of the blaze, which then spread to a canopy covering one of the entrances. The governor of Alexandria said two people were hurt as a result of the fire, with one breaking a leg running away and another suffering from smoke inhalation. The fire broke out less than a week after 41 people, including 18 children, were killed during a blaze at a Coptic church in Cairo. The interior ministry blamed the tragedy on an electrical malfunction, and Christians haveblamedsupposedly discriminatory regulations for preventing renovation work on churches in the predominantly Muslim country.

Relations between the two nations were downgraded back in 2018 after Israeli forces killed some 60 Palestinians during protests on the Gaza border. Ankara at the time condemned the heavy-handed treatment of demonstrators by Israel. A statement released by the premier s office, following talks between Lapid and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said: it was decided to once again upgrade the level of the relations between the two countries to that of full diplomatic ties and to return ambassadors and consuls general. The normalization would, among other things, help strengthen regional stability, it added. Prime Minister Lapid was also quoted as describing the move as important economic news for the citizens of Israel. With the normalization of relations having been in the pipeline for some time, President Erdogan earlier noted that restoring ties with Israel would allow Ankara to help our Palestinian brothers. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the press in Ankara that his ministry was already looking for the right candidate to become the country s ambassador to Israel. Following a visit to Turkey by Israeli President Isaac Herzog in March and subsequent visits by foreign ministers, Israel announced the reopening of its trade office in Istanbul. The two countries have also signed an aviation agreement, which allows Israeli airlines to fly to Turkey. In recent years, Israel has been making concerted efforts to normalize its traditionally strained relations with some Muslim nations. 2020 saw the signing of the so-called Abraham Accords between the Jewish state on one side and the United Arab Emirates on the other. Similar accords between Israel, Bahrain and Morocco followed soon thereafter. That same year, Turkey also began its attempts to normalize relations with other regional powers, such as Egypt, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia.

"7 Aug, 2022",Israel agrees to Gaza truce media,"If the Palestinian Islamic Jihad accepts the deal, the latest round of fighting that began on Friday will end with a ceasefire Israel agreed on Sunday to an Egyptian-brokered truce in Gaza, Reuters reported. It remains unclear whether the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) will accept the deal. The group continued to fire rockets into Israel as the news broke. Egypt has made contacts with everyone to defuse the rapidly-escalating conflict between Israel and the PIJ, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Saturday, as an intelligence delegation from Cairo arrived in Israel. Egyptian sources told Reuters on Sunday that the delegation had proposed a ceasefire beginning later in the evening, which the Israeli side agreed to. If the report is true, the PIJ s leadership must now decide whether to accept the truce. A source within the militant group told AFP that it is participating in ceasefire talks. The PIJ stepped up its rocket attacks on Israel early Sunday afternoon, with air raid sirens sounding in Ashkelon and other settlements near the Jewish state s border with Gaza, and some projectiles threatening the city of Beersheba. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted 97% of the roughly 500 rockets that made it out of Gaza over two days of fighting. Israel targeted what it said were PIJ rocket launch posts in Gaza in response, posting video footage of airstrikes on these positions. Israel s military mission, Operation Breaking Dawn, began on Friday with an airstrike on the home of senior PIJ commander Taysir al-Jabari. Other strikes targeted the group s observation posts, warehouses, and launch sites, while another senior PIJ commander was killed by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday night, the IDF stated on Sunday. Israel has described its strikes as targeted, and said that Operation Breaking Dawn was launched amid the imminent threat of attack from the PIJ following the arrest of the group s leader on Monday. However, Palestinian officials say that 31 people have been killed in Gaza among them six children while 265 Gazans have been wounded. Israel has denied responsibility for at least nine of these deaths, which the IDF blamed on a Palestinian rocket that fell short after launch. With several of its senior leaders killed or arrested, it is unclear whether the PIJ intends to agree to the Egyptian-brokered truce. A spokesman for the group claimed on Sunday that the militants had used only a small part of their capabilities, and called on Palestinians in the West Bank to join their offensive. Hamas, the largest Palestinian militant group, has thus far stayed out of the current round of fighting. Before news of the potential truce broke, Israeli Intelligence Minister Elazar Stern told Army Radio that Israel has made very significant achievements in the operation, and that the IDF would continue to respond to rocket attacks. However, Stern said that if [the PIJ] requests a deal we aren t seeking war. ",https://www.rt.com/news/560406-israel-gaza-ceasefire-announced/
"3 Aug, 2022","As Lebanon suffers an unprecedented food crisis, Ukraine uses Western support to block flour and wheat from its markets","By making accusations about grain 'stolen' by Russia, Kiev makes Lebanon a target of US-led pressure Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . A Syrian-flagged ship named the Laodicea that docked in the Lebanese port of Tripoli was detained last Saturday, preventing desperately needed flour and barley from reaching people in the Middle East. The move came after Western threats against Beirut and unsubstantiated claims from Kiev that the cargo was stolen from Ukraine. The ship, which has been on a US blacklist since 2015 for allegedly carrying shipments from sanctioned Crimea, is now under investigation. On Friday, allegations emerged in Western media, citing the Ukrainian embassy in Beirut, that stolen flour and barley had been transferred to the Lebanese port of Tripoli and that Kiev had warned the Lebanese government against buying the grain. The news was said to have sparked protests from Western governments warning Lebanon s Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, over the allegedly stolen cargo. It later turned out that Kiev possessed no evidence that the flour and barley aboard the ship was from Ukraine. Despite this, Lebanon has nowseizedthe ship and will act according to legal proceedings on the issue, after reported Western pressure. The Ukrainian embassy in Beiruttold Reutersthat ""the ship has traveled from a Crimean port that is closed to international shipping, carrying 5,000 tonnes of barley and 5,000 tonnes of flour that we suspect was taken from Ukrainian stores,""without presenting evidence to support the claim. An official from a private firm responsible for the import of the grain, Loyal Agro Co LTD, based in Turkey, not onlydeniedthat the goods were Ukrainian, but also clarified that the ship was carrying8,000 tonnes of flour and 1,700 tonnes of barleyin total. The vessel was also said to have been seeking private buyers in Lebanon, not a sale to the Lebanese government, and was destined to travel on to Syria after its stop in Tripoli. Additionally, the Russian embassy in Beirut said that it had no information regarding the Syrian vessel or a cargo brought to Lebanon by a private company. An official at the Lebanese port authority also stated that there was nothing wrong with the cargo aboard the ship. None of this however, was enough to prevent the issue being pursued and for Lebanon to be threatened. What makes this issue troubling, is that - without evidence Western nations and Kiev can openly pressure Lebanon to keep much needed supplies away from its people, in this case potentially forever and for at least 72 hours under detention. The country is currently suffering its worst ever economic collapse,enduring shortages in food, medicine, electricity and essential goods. According to some UN estimates, some78%of the Lebanese population now live in poverty. The food shortage has led tolong queues at bakeries, sometimes resulting in gunfire and brawls between people fighting over the limited supply of bread. The Ukraine crisis has made Lebanon s predicament even tougher, with a lack of flow of supplies from Ukraine and difficulties bringing in Russian goods due to sanctions. The Western Caesar Act sanctions against Syria have also made the situation even worse, as Lebanon has historically benefited greatly from its bigger neighbor. What Kiev is doing, by threatening the future of bilateral relations between Lebanon and Ukraine over this issue, could be interpreted as blackmail. Ukraine has20 million tonnes of wheatthat it still hasn t exported and a severing of relations with Beirut would mean that Lebanon could potentially miss out on acquiring it during a food shortage. The Lebanese government is clearly in a weak position and Kiev, backed by the power of NATO, is now attempting to bully Beirut over unsubstantiated claims that are denied by all sides, notwithstanding that officials won t even state the allegation with certainty. Another issue here is the double-standard at play, whilst Western nations suffer economically themselves, there is no hesitation at sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine every other week. Yet when it comes to simply amending sanctions, after pledging to do so, in order to allow Egypt tosendgas to ease the energy crisis in Lebanon, Washington still refuses to allow it, a year later. Instead, based upon unsubstantiated claims, Lebanon is forced to suffer even more by having basic food supplies dangled over its head. Whilst the West acts holier-than-thou on the issue of unsubstantiated claims of Ukraine s grain being sold by private firms in Lebanon, it seemingly forgets that the US illegally occupies neighboring Syria s most fertile agricultural lands, in addition to the majority of its oil and gas fields. America has repeatedly been accused of smuggling Syrian grain and oil into Iraq, resources which should belong to the Syrian government and could be part of the answer to Lebanon s current shortage.",https://www.rt.com/russia/560047-ukraine-lebanon-food-crisis/

In an interview on Sunday with a state-owned broadcaster the president said Algeria largely meets the conditions for joining BRICS already. The group is named for its member states Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa and it plans to consider adding Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt at its summit next year. At this year s BRICS summit, held online in June, the format was expanded to include participation by 13 other countries, including Algeria. President Tebboune was the first guest to speak, calling for a new economic order where parity and equity between countries will reign. Our past experiences have shown us that the imbalance recorded on the international scene and the marginalization of emerging countries within world bodies constitute a source of instability, lack of equity and absence of development, the Algerian president added. BRICS nations already account for more than 40% of the world s population. The bloc s stated goals are to promote peace, security, development, global cooperation and the development of humanity. Iran and Argentina formally applied to join the group in June. Russia, China and other BRICS members are reportedly developing a new global reserve currency, potentially undermining the dominance of the US dollar. Tebboune said during the same television interview that Algeria, a former French colony, will start teaching English in elementary schools this year.

"31 Jul, 2022",Major buyer cancels Ukrainian wheat deal Reuters,"Egypt has reportedly found alternative grain suppliers Egypt has cancelled an order for 240,000 tons of Ukrainian wheat that was earlier booked for delivery last February and March but not shipped due to the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reported this week. This comes as Kiev prepares to resume grain exports via the Black Sea following an agreement with Moscow. Egypt s procurement authority released the suppliers from their contractual obligations this week, Reuters said citing its sources, adding that it was unclear whether the contracts were cancelled before or after the internationally-brokered deal was reached. After being unable to receive its supply from Ukraine, Egypt, one of the world s biggest wheat importers, bought the grain elsewhere. According to media reports, in June the country purchased more than a million tons of wheat from Romania, Bulgaria, France and Russia. Bloomberg reports that Egypt now has more than seven months of wheat stockpiles. Moscow and Kiev agreed to restart grain exports via the Black Sea last Friday with the first ship expected to set sail within days. An estimated 20 million tons of grain are awaiting shipping from Ukrainian ports. The deal was hailed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres as a beacon of hope and relief and was widely described as a diplomatic breakthrough that would do much to alleviate the global food crisis. Ukraine s main grain export, corn, accounts for over 15% of the global supply. The biggest buyer is the EU, which uses it mainly as animal fodder. Ukraine s share of the world s wheat exports in 2021 stood at 10% with Egypt and Indonesia its main customers. The eastern European country ranks fifth among global wheat exporters after the US, Canada, Russia and the EU. Ukraine produces just 3% of the total global wheat output, according to data from the economy and business branch of the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper. Among the country s other grain exports are barley, millet, oats and rye. ",https://www.rt.com/business/559806-egypt-ukraine-grain-supplies/
"29 Jul, 2022",Macron insulted African nations Lavrov,"Russia hit back at the French president for speaking ill of African states that maintain ties with Moscow French President Emmanuel Macron s claims that Moscow backs illegitimate regimes in Africa are insulting to the countries on the continent, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. If I remember correctly, he said that he was concerned with Russia s military and diplomatic activity in Africa and with what he said was not cooperation, but the support for absolutely failed, illegitimate regimes and juntas, Lavrov told reporters during his trip to Uzbekistan on Friday. If we look at the list of states we visited in Africa, and if that is what he said, it s rather insulting for the African countries, which, despite everything, continue to consistently develop relations with the Russian Federation. Lavrov visited Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia during his four-day trip to the continent before arriving in Uzbekistan on Thursday. Macron was in Africa around the same time, visiting Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau. Speaking in Cameroon, a former French colony, on Tuesday, Macron called Russia one of the last imperial colonial powers. He accused Moscow of backing weakened political powers and military juntas that have no legitimacy in Africa. Macron also voiced concerns over the work of the Russia-linked private military company Wagner in Mali and Central African Republic. The Kremlin has denied Wagner represents the Russian government. Lavrov said last year that the private contractor had been invited by the Malian authorities to fight terrorists as the French troops stationed in the country were in the process of withdrawal.

"28 Jul, 2022",Murderer could be hanged on live TV,"An Egyptian court says broadcasting the execution could serve as a deterrent for other would-be criminals A court in Egypt has called for the live TV hanging of a convicted murderer, arguing that it could help deter copycat killers, according to a letter quoted by local media on Sunday. During a highly-publicized two-day trial earlier this month, 21-year-old Mohamed Adel was convicted for killing fellow student Nayera Ashraf outside Mansoura University in northern Egypt in late June. It was reported that Adel stalked the girl for some time, and when she refused to marry him, he devised a gruesome plot to kill her. According to video footage of the incident, which went viral on social media and sparked outrage across the country, Adel repeatedly stabbed Ashraf as she got off a bus near the university, jumped on her, and slit her throat in front of a number of horrified onlookers. Adel pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to death on July 6. However, due to the heinous nature of the murder, the court now wants to make an example out of Adel, and has asked the government to allow a live national TV broadcast of the execution. The Mansoura Courthouse wrote a letter to Egypt s parliament explaining that publicizing the sentencing was not enough to deter similar crimes from happening in the future. The broadcast, even if only part of the start of proceedings, could achieve the goal of deterrence, which was not achieved by broadcasting the sentencing itself, the letter reads, as reported by local media. Adel s attorney, Farid El-Deeb, who was a defense lawyer for the late ex-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, insists that his client does not deserve the death penalty and has vowed to appeal the verdict. The last time a capital punishment was broadcast on Egyptian national television was in 1998, when the state executed three men who killed a woman and her two children in their home in Cairo. The murder of Ashraf, as well as other high-profile killings of women in Jordan and the UAE that happened within the same month have caused an uproar across the region and on social media. Women s rights activists are now demanding justice and decrying the recent surge in violence against women in the Arab world. The Egyptian Edraak Foundation for Development and Equality has said that it has documented 335 violent crimes against women and girls in Egypt between January and April of this year alone and that the country has been witnessing a notable rise in gender-based violence, with 813 cases being reported in 2021 compared to 415 in 2020. According to a 2015 UN survey, nearly eight million Egyptian women claim to have experienced violence perpetrated by their husbands or relatives or by strangers on the street.

In an interview with Spanish radio station Cadena SER on Tuesday, Borrell touched on the Russian foreign minister s recent tour of Egypt, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Uganda, saying: Lavrov goes to Africa and tries to persuade the Africans that sanctions are to blame for all that s happening... and the whole of the Western media repeats it. I go to Africa to say the opposite, that sanctions have nothing to do with it, and nobody picks it up, he lamented. The EU foreign policy chief explained the attention Lavrov is getting, saying: There s a certain tendency to listen to the enemy, the adversary. Lies circulate faster than the truth, and because of this Brussels should redouble efforts to explain its stance to the public, he concluded. The US news magazine Politico echoed the comparison between the diplomats Africa trips in an article on Monday, saying the contest for an African audience, between the EU and Russian diplomats, was lopsided in favour of Lavrov. An opinion piece, explaining the role of the US and the EU in Africa s food crisis, which the Russian foreign minister penned before his tour of the continent, was picked up by scores of local media outlets and shared by thousands of people on Facebook, it pointed out. Over the same time period, Josep Borrell was a virtual ghost online, based on data from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool owned by Meta. He garnered just one mention on Facebook about Africa compared to Lavrov s tidal wave of coverage, Politico wrote. According to the outlet, this situation highlights what many within EU political circles have known for years, but few are willing to acknowledge publicly. In the information battle with Moscow, Brussels remains outmatched, outgunned and under-resourced to combat the Kremlin's sophisticated playbook, it concluded. Last week, Ukraine, Russia, the UN and Turkey signed a deal to unblock exports of grain from Ukrainian ports. In addition, Russia and the United Nations signed a memorandum implying the UN s involvement in lifting restrictions on the export of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets. Borrell welcomed the agreement, saying it offers an opportunity to start reversing this negative course set by Russia s military operation in Ukraine, which has endangered food security for millions of people. Russia has rejected Western claims that the blockage of grain exports from Ukraine s Black Sea ports has put the world on the brink off a food crisis. Speaking in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Sunday, Lavrov said the true cause of the problem was illegitimate restrictions imposed on Moscow by the US, EU and their allies, which have prevented operations with Russian grain [food and fertilizers], including insurance, including the admission of our ships to foreign ports and foreign ships entry into Russian ports. Russia is not asking for all sanctions to be lifted, but our Western colleagues... should remove the obstacles they themselves have created, the foreign minister insisted.

We want to trade with Russia and we want to trade with all the countries of the world. We don t believe in being enemies of somebody s enemy. We want to make our own enemies, not fight other people s enemies. This is our doctrine, stated the Ugandan president. The African leader noted that Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, have supported Uganda and the African anti-colonial movement for over 100 years and have never caused the country any harm. Noting Uganda s rich natural resources, Museveni said he hoped his country could further increase cooperation with Russia in areas such as space science, nuclear energy, medicine, and food. He also insisted that he didn t understand the calls for Africa to automatically take an anti-Russian stance, noting that Uganda can t turn against countries that have never caused it any harm, especially considering it has even forgiven its colonial oppressors of the past and now works with them as well. The joint press conference was held amid Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov s diplomatic tour of Africa and marked the first time a top Russian official has ever visited Uganda. On Sunday, Lavrov met with his counterpart in Egypt, where it was revealed that a group of Western ambassadors from the US, France, Germany, the UK, and the EU had warned Egyptian officials against posing for pictures with Russia s top diplomat. When Museveni was asked if he had received similar warnings, he joked that no one was so stupid as to ask him such a thing, noting that his position has always been clear, that he is not pro-East or pro-West, but pro-himself. The Ugandan leader went on to outline the strategy of the African Freedom movement, explaining that countries that are progressive forces that aim to improve the condition of man irrespective of social systems will always be welcomed. Museveni provided the examples of China and Saudi Arabia, which do not share the same social system as Uganda, but are nevertheless successfully improving living conditions in their respective countries. We welcome [these countries] because they are handling the aspect of oppression of man by nature, mitigating the suffering of man at the hands of nature, controlling floods, disease and so on, said the president, noting that, if one country made progress, it was a benefit to other nations. This is the correct understanding of progress for the whole human race, he remarked. The Ugandan leader went on to state that when there was progress and stability in Russia, it was a benefit to Uganda as well, since it allowed more trade and cooperation with Russia in various areas. This is what we are looking for. Win-win cooperation for everybody in the world, Museveni said, adding that he rejects the idea of rivalry between countries, stating that it is not part of the African Liberation Movement s strategy.

"23 Jul, 2022",Middle Eastern oil exports to EU surge Bloomberg,"The change comes as Russia redirects shipments to China and India Crude oil shipments from countries in the Middle East to the EU have soared by 90% since January, as the bloc snubs Russian oil due to sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing vessel-tracking data. According to the report, deliveries have so far nearly doubled compared to last year. Bloomberg estimates that in the first three weeks of July, more than 1 million barrels a day were pumped through the Sumed pipeline through Egypt to the EU from the Middle East, mainly from Saudi Arabia. Another 1.2 million, mostly from Iraq, came via the Suez Canal. The news outlet estimates that this is 90% more than what the EU received from the region in January, the last month before the start of Russia s military operation in Ukraine, which was swiftly followed by sanctions on Moscow, including Russian energy supplies. In early June, the bloc introduced another round of embargoes, including a partial embargo on Russian oil a ban on deliveries by sea. In response, Moscow offered a discount on oil, which was quickly snatched up by India and China. Both countries have increased their purchases over the past several months. While the EU may have found a substitute for Russian oil in the Middle East, Bloomberg analysts warn of the consequences it may face after the oil embargo comes into effect by the end of the year. Part of the measure is a ban on insuring shipments of Russian oil to buyers worldwide, which could become a problem for overall oil shipments and boost competition for supplies from the Middle East, Bloomberg writes.

"20 Jul, 2022",Russia begins building Egypt s first nuclear power plant,"Led by Rosatom, the $30 billion project is expected to be completed by 2028 Russian state-owned energy giant Rosatom has begun construction on the El Dabaa nuclear power plant, the company said in a press release published on Wednesday. The start of construction on the El Dabaa power plant s first reactor means Egypt is now joining the club of the world s nuclear energy producing nations, Rosatom CEO Alexey Likhachyov said at a ceremony launching the construction. Located on Egypt s northern coast, some 130 kilometers northwest of Cairo, El Dabaa will be Egypt s first nuclear power plant as well as Rosatom s first major project in Africa. The plant, which is set to be completed by 2028, will have four VVER-1200 reactors with a total nameplate capacity of 4,800 megawatts. The construction is financed jointly by Moscow and Cairo, with the Russian government providing 85% of the $30 billion cost in the form of a state loan. The rest will be funded by Egypt with financial backing from private investors. Under the terms of agreements signed by the two countries, Rosatom will also be supplying nuclear fuel for the plant for its entire 60-year design lifetime, and providing maintenance and repairs for ten years after the launch of each reactor. Additionally, the company will provide staff training. The first group of future El Dabaa employees started their training at the Saint-Petersburg branch of the company s Technical Academy back in September 2021. Rosatom is expecting to train 1,700 specialists for the plant in total, both at its academy and at the plant s own training facility in Egypt. Involved in a number of large-scale international projects ‚Äî including the ITER initiative aimed at developing practical nuclear fusion ‚Äî Rosatom has not been targeted by any of the sanctions imposed on Russia since the start of its military operation in Ukraine on February 24. However, the company did see its power plant construction deal with Finnish group Fennovoima scrapped in May, a move the latter justified as necessary due to risks associated with the conflict.

"18 Jul, 2022",Dmitri Trenin: How a smart Middle East strategy can help Russia play a significant role in shaping the new world order,"Almost uniquely, Moscow gets on with all the major regional players it needs to harness this to its advantage This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin travels to Tehran for a summit of the guarantors of the so-called Astana process, which aims to find a political settlement in Syria. Apart from a joint session with the other two participants, Iran s Ibrahim Raisi and Turkey s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin will hold talks with each separately. The visit comes soon after the Russian leader's trip to Tajikistan and Turkmenistan the latter for the Caspian summit that brought together Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and the host state. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, has recently traveled to Algeria, Bahrain, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, where he also met with counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. With relations between Russia and the West beyond repair for the foreseeable future, Russian diplomacy is focusing on non-Western countries, and the Middle East and North Africa feature prominently in Moscow s new foreign-policy geography. Since Russia s spectacular return to that part of the world in 2015 by means of a military intervention in Syria, the MENA region has been the principal area where Moscow s post-Soviet approach to foreign affairs has taken shape, and where it has been most successful. Key elements of that approach have included: focusing strictly on Russia s own national interests, while acknowledging the concerns of regional states; being flexible and able to manage differences with the main partners; staying in touch with all relevant players, while neither patronizing nor antagonizing anyone; managing relations with states which see each other as antagonists; and refraining from imposing any selfish design or demands on the region. This has worked, so far. Not that Russia s record in the Middle East is impeccable it has had its share of mistakes and failures but it has been remarkably better than in many other parts of the world, including some much closer to home. This is even more remarkable when you consider the diversity of the Middle East and the intensity of conflicts there. As a result, this pattern of foreign policy making, based on profound knowledge of, expertise in, and empathy toward the region, which has miraculously survived and expanded in various agencies in the immediate post-Soviet years, makes it a useful template for adapting to other regional dimensions of Moscow s global foreign policy. Since the start of the Russian military campaign in Ukraine, the importance of the MENA region to Moscow has grown substantially. With the airspace over the European Union off limits to Russia, Istanbul has turned into the main air transport hub for Russian travelers heading west. Wealthy Russians, no longer welcome in London, have flocked to Dubai. Meanwhile, the collapse of commerce along the traditional trading routes across the Russia-EU borders, the Baltic and the Black Seas gives a powerful boost to the North-South corridor from St. Petersburg to Mumbai via Iran and the Caspian. Turkey has emerged as the preferred venue for Moscow s official contacts with Kiev and along with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the United Arab Emirates it's now one of the few places where Russians and Westerners can have a dialogue on de facto neutral ground. Of fundamental importance, of course, is the refusal of Middle Eastern countries to join the US-led sanctions war targeting Russia. In the Kremlin s optics, not being against Russia means being friendly toward it. This enhanced importance of the MENA region calls for revising upward Moscow s regional strategy. Its general goal would remain maintaining functioning, friendly relationships with the countries of the region, to promote economic cooperation in defiance of the sanctions regime and to protect security along Russia s southern borders. Some of the principal building blocks of that updated and enhanced strategy could include: While the updated strategy does not completely shun interaction with Western countries e.g., on the Syrian conflict or on the Iranian nuclear program, it needs to view the West, primarily the United States and the European Union, as opponents seeking to completely isolate Russia. As such, the West s policies will aim at defeating Russia s regional strategy. Cooperation with the West in these circumstances has to be limited to the few issues that serve Russian interests and are in line with the values supported by the Russian people. Given that with the exception of Iran and Syria all other MENA countries maintain active and close relations with Washington and depend on the US for political support, financial or military assistance, technology or access to the American market, Russia s strategy needs to be resourceful in dealing with the obstacles and limitations imposed by those dependencies, while offering tangible benefits to Moscow s regional partners. At the same time, Russia will need to engage its major strategic partners, China and India, with a view to coordinating their policies on the Middle East, to the extent that it's both feasible and advisable.

"17 Jul, 2022",US fueling tension in Middle East with Iranophobia FM,"Tehran has accused the Biden administration of turning Iran s neighbors against it The US is attempting to stoke tensions across the Middle East by relying on the failed policy of Iranophobia, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said on Sunday, following US President Joe Biden s visit to the region. The US was the first country to deploy a nuclear bomb it constantly interferes with other countries affairs, has launched armed conflicts, and has sold massive amounts of arms across the region, the official continued. He added that Washington was also, via its unflinching support for Israel, the main accessory to the continued occupation of Palestinian lands, daily crimes of the regime against Palestinians, and apartheid. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Thursday threatened the US and its allies with a harsh and regrettable response should they make a mistake in dealing with Iran, accusing Washington and Israel of creating instability in the region. His statement came after US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed an agreement pledging never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome. Biden later signed a statement in partnership with Saudi Arabia denouncing the increasing threat posed by Iranian-made drones. Washington has repeatedly accused Tehran of attempting to sell such drones to Russia, allegations Iran has repeatedly denied. The US withdrew from the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal in 2018 under former president Donald Trump. Despite campaign promises to resurrect the deal, which would involve a repeal of anti-Iranian sanctions in return for restricting uranium enrichment, Biden made no progress on the issue during his first trip to the Middle East. Biden reassured US allies in the Gulf that Washington was not planning on leaving the region. During a summit of Gulf Cooperation Council nations plus Egypt, Jordan and Iraq in Jeddah, he promised: We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran. While some of Washington s Middle Eastern allies favor uniting against Tehran, with King Abdullah of Jordan recently making reference to a Middle East NATO, others including the United Arab Emirates have resisted the idea, preferring cooperation.

"16 Jul, 2022",US is dominant in the Middle East The White House,"President Joe Biden s administration has claimed Washington is the partner of choice for Middle Eastern states Washington has re-established itself under President Joe Biden s watch as the dominant security and economic partner desired by Middle East governments, halting a trend toward countries seeking closer ties with Russia and China, a senior White House official has claimed. If you go back to this region, say, I don t know, 18 months ago, you heard an awful lot of just really significant hedging and, I would say, in many capitals, a real drift towards Russia and even China in many ways, a Biden administration official told reporters on Friday. Really, that has been arrested and, in many instances, very specific instances not all which I can talk about reversed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, touting Biden s alleged accomplishments during the president s four-day trip to the Middle East this week. Wrapping up his first visit to the region since taking office in January 2021, Biden met with the leaders of nine countries at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) +3 Summit in Saudi Arabia before heading back to Washington on Saturday. When asked why none of the countries represented at the summit had sanctioned Russia over the Ukraine conflict, the senior White House staffer insisted that the US is winning the geopolitical battle for influence in the Middle East. He said it s only natural that GCC members and other countries in the region also have relationships with Russia and China. But when it comes to the partnerships and the partnerships of choice, and particularly in the security realm but also in the trade, investment, commerce, tech realm we heard from every capital around this region that their first choice, their priority, is the United States of America, he said. And that is something that we are very much committed to following up on and finding areas in which we can partner. The official argued that Biden s visit made clear that the US has no intent to leave a vacuum here in the Middle East, particularly for Russia or China to fill, or for that matter, Iran. He noted with concern that Russian delegations reportedly visited Iran in recent weeks to view attack-capable drones that might be used in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to visit Tehran on Tuesday. Russia is effectively making a bet on Iran, and we are making a bet on a more integrated, more stable, more peaceful and prosperous Middle East region, the White House official said. After years of attempts at nation-building and regime changes through military force, which were out of America s reach to deliver and drained our attention and resources and capacity, the US has changed course, the staffer said. We are focused on what we think is a far more realistic set of objectives, very central to our interests and the interests of our partners. Biden s strategy is based on Washington s ability to build alliances, integrate the region, find connections that don t exist, and strengthen the ties that develop, the White House official said. I think it is an era in which the unique capabilities of the United States can play a really important role here in forging new partnerships and strengthening alliances and coalitions, he said.

"14 Jul, 2022",Might of the Islamic Revolution: Can Iranian drones help Russia in Ukraine?,"It is very unlikely that Iran will step up its confrontation with the West just to supply UAVs to Russia, experts say. Last Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan claimed that Iran is preparing to send ""several hundred"" UAVs to Russia, to be used in Moscow s military operation in Ukraine. Iran outright rejected the claim and Russia has made no comments on the statement. Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow announced that President Vladimir Putin will be visiting the Iranian capital next week to hold talks with President Ebrahim Raisi. Here, RT looks into Iranian drones to see whether they could be of use to Russia in the course of the special operation in Ukraine. We will also explain why the US is alarmed by the prospect and how this development could affect the likelihood of the sanctions on Iran being lifted. According to our intel ""Our information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline,""Sullivan asserted. He was talking to reporters about Ukraine therefore, while it wasn t explicitly stated, one can assume that the US now expects Iranian drones to see action in Eastern Europe. It s unclear whether Iran has delivered any of these UAVs to Russia already, Sullivan said, adding that the country will start training Russian forces to use the drones as early as this month. This is just one example of how Russia is looking to countries like Iran for capabilities that... have been used before we got the ceasefire in place in Yemen to attack Saudi Arabia, Sullivan explained. It was early Tuesday morning in Moscow when the briefing was broadcast in the US, but Russian officials are yet to make any comments about the subject. There was, however, other news from the Kremlin, as presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that Vladimir Putin would visit Tehran the following week, on July 19. The agenda and details of the bilateral meeting between Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi have not been disclosed. There will be a meeting of the heads of the guarantor states of the Astana process, which, as you know, is the process to facilitate a resolution to the Syrian crisis. There will, indeed, be a meeting between Putin, Raisi and Erdogan. In addition to the trilateral meeting, bilateral talks will also take place, Peskov said. As for Tehran, it flatly denied it has any plans to cooperate with Russia by supplying it with UAVs. When asked about the claim by a media representative, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said: Cooperation between Iran and Russia in certain advanced technologies dates back to before the Ukraine war, and there have been no major developments in the area in the recent past. What we know about Iranian UAVs Washington had been wary of Iran s drone program even before Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine. Last November, the US introduced sanctions against Iranian private companies that were supposedly involved in the production of combat and reconnaissance UAVs. According to the Americans, these companies claimed to be engaged in private research while covertly providing critical support to the UAV development of Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and conducting international transactions in the interests of the Iranian government. The latter, in turn, supplied drones to its allies including groups that the US recognizes as terrorist organizations. Notably, even back then, the US Treasury Department insisted that Iranian UAVs threaten international peace and stability. Denis Fedutinov, editor-in-chief of the magazine Drone Aviation, told RT that Iranian drones are actually very much worth looking into the country has been designing them since the 1980s. Currently, Iran has several dozen drone systems, from miniature drones to medium-altitude long-endurance models, he said. Some Iranian UAVs were inspired by the US designs. For example, the Qods Yasir is based on the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle intercepted by the Iranians in 2012, while the Shahed 171 Simorgh and Saegheh-2 have a lot in common with the RQ-170 Sentinel that violated Iranian airspace in 2011. Visually similar to the US MQ-1 Predator, the Shahed 129 attack drones are of particular interest, as they have played an active role in the civil war in Syria since 2014. Iran isn t too keen on sharing information on its drones, revealing only what s beneficial to it. But doubtless, one of its advantages is its vast experience in UAV development, Denis Fedutinov noted. Nevertheless, Iranian technology cannot hold a candle to its Turkish competition. Turkish designers partner with the leading suppliers of various drone subsystems in the market, which makes it easier for them to develop more sophisticated equipment. Why does Russia need Iranian drones? Viktor Litovkin, a retired colonel and military commentator for TASS, told RT that all drones are essentially the same. The only difference is their role, their loadout and their flight time. Iran doesn t have any outstanding drones, but nor does anybody else. All drones are essentially the same, he explained. Moscow has also been developing its own UAVs for quite some time. Russian Vice Prime Minister Yuri Borisov, who is in charge of supervision of the defense industry, said last month that Russia has access to almost all types of unmanned military aerial systems, including reconnaissance, attack, tactical, operational and operational-tactical models. At the same time, he doesn t deny that Russia should ve recognized the benefits of drones much earlier. Answering RT s question about the shortage of drones, Borisov promised to ramp up production, adding, it takes time. This may be interpreted as a sign that Russia considers Iranian drones to be a temporary solution until Russian drones are put into service. Fedutinov argues that if a deal were to be signed, Moscow would be interested mainly in heavy recon and attack UAV systems. Had they been available to the Russian Army, I don t see any obstacles to fielding such systems [in Ukraine]. And as far as civilian casualties or friendly fire are concerned, drones carry high-precision weapon systems that minimize those risks, Fedutinov said. Litovkin expressed doubt that Iranian drones would see any use in Ukraine. No type of weapon could change the course of the war. Well, nuclear weapons could, but escalating the conflict in Ukraine to a nuclear war is out of the question. Drones are not weapons per se, they are combat platforms, he said. Will Iran be able to cover Russia s UAV demand? It sounds like Iranian companies have been able to launch mass production of drones. And we can even say that they have begun to sell their UAV systems to certain customers, Fedutinov said when asked if Iran was capable of exporting drones. Litovkin agrees. According to him, Iran has manufactured a significant number of drones that are just being stored at warehouses right now. Iran is not engaged in any wars, so it doesn t need all those drones, while Russia could use them in its Ukraine campaign. It is no wonder then that we could buy different types of UAVs from Iran, the military expert believes. Vladimir Sazhin, from the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences and an expert on Iran, disagrees: Iran has many adversaries in the region, including Israel, the Gulf countries, Jordan and Egypt. There have even been proposals to establish a Middle Eastern NATO. All these developments keep pressure on Iran, so I don t think it will jeopardize its defense capabilities by giving its drones to some other country. Sazhin also has doubts about Teheran s ability to mass produce and export UAVs, Iran supplies drones to its allies mostly, Yemen s Houthis, and we can hardly count them in the hundreds, dozens would be a more realistic estimate, and we don t even know the type. Besides military drones, Iran also manufactures simple models, almost like toys. I don t think Iran is capable of increasing the scale of production in such limited time. The systems that are manufactured in Iran right now can hardly be exported. What else stands in the way? I don t think there was any kind of plan to sell drones to Russia before February 24. Maybe there were some discussions after that, but I doubt anything will actually happen, Sazhin says. He believes that political considerations are also involved, Iran is neutral on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Its unwavering position is that a ceasefire should be reached as soon as possible. I don t think Iran plans to take either side, by supporting Russia and opposing the West. He also said that Tehran is heavily invested in the Vienna talks on resuming the Iranian nuclear deal, which was basically abolished by the Donald Trump administration. Iran wants to see this deal come through, because it wants the Western sanctions to be lifted. The EU, Japan and other countries support Teheran in its agenda. They can t wait for the sanctions to be eased, because that will give them instant access to the Iranian economy, which has been in dire straits. Tehran really needs external investments in all industries. And technology. Obviously, Russia can t help it with either, while the EU and Japan can, Sazhin explained. The expert also notes that by supplying Russia with drones Iran would face more pressure from the West, which would jeopardize its future partnerships with countries that could provide investment and technology. That is not the kind of risk Iran is ready to take, this configuration doesn t benefit it, Sazhin added. The expert says that a behind-the-scenes deal between Moscow and Teheran is also impossible. Today, a deal like that would remain a secret for only a few hours. Even if Iran secretly supplies Russia with its drones, they will be discovered in the combat zone. This would put Iran in an even more difficult situation, according to Sazhin.

She is the president of BRICS International Forum, an independent socio-economic political center working among BRICS nations, and not a BRICS official. The article has been amended to reflect that. Riyadh, Ankara, and Cairo plan to join BRICS, and their potential membership bids could be discussed and decided upon at next year s summit of the bloc in South Africa, Purnima Anand, the president of the BRICS International Forum, told Russian media on Thursday. All these countries have shown their interest in joining [BRICS] and are preparing to apply for membership. I believe this is a good step, because expansion is always looked upon favorably; it will definitely bolster BRICS global influence, the head of the independent socio-economic political center working among BRICS nations told the Russian newspaper Izvestia. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) account for over 40% of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world s GDP. The bloc s stated purposes include promoting peace, security, development, and cooperation globally, and contributing to the development of humanity. Anand said the issue of expansion was raised during this year s BRICS summit, which took place in late June in Beijing. The BRICS International Forum president said she hopes the accession of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt will not take much time, given that they are already engaged in the process, though doubts that all three will join the alliance at the same time. I hope that these countries will join the BRICS quite shortly, as all the representatives of core members are interested in expansion. So it will come very soon, Anand added. The news of the three nations plans to join BRICS comes after Iran and Argentina officially applied for membership in late June, with Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh touting the bloc as a very creative mechanism with broad aspects.

A UN report released on Monday predicts that the global population could increase to around 8.5 billion in 2030, to 9.7 billion in 2050 and to 10.4 billion in 2100. According to the UN, the world s population is on the rise in part due to declining mortality, with global life expectancy reaching 72.8 years in 2019, which is almost nine years longer than it was in 1990. At the same time, the organization said that the pace of the growth is gradually slowing down. The report titled World Population Prospects 2022 also projects that the population will be increasing unequally across the world, with just eight developing countries accounting for more than a half of the anticipated growth. The countries in question are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania.

At the same time, he noted that the eight-billion milestone is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, wars and humanitarian disasters had shown that the world is in peril. Guterres said that the world is still plagued by vast gender inequality and assaults on women s rights.

"10 Jul, 2022",Developing world to face wave of defaults Bloomberg,"National bankruptcies to precede political instability in emerging economies Emerging nations, including El Salvador, Ghana, Egypt, Tunisia and Pakistan, will be challenged with a historic cascade of defaults as a quarter-trillion-dollar pile of distressed debts exerts downward pressure on economies, Bloomberg is reporting. With the low-income countries, debt risks and debt crises are not hypothetical, the World Bank s Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart told the agency on Saturday. We re pretty much already there. Over the past six months, there s reportedly been a doubling in the number of emerging markets with sovereign debt that trades at highly distressed levels, meaning yields that indicate investors believe default is a real possibility. Another cause for major concern reportedly arises from a potential domino effect that commonly occurs when scared investors begin yanking money out of countries with economic problems. In June, traders reportedly pulled $4 billion out of emerging-market bonds and stocks, marking a fourth straight month of outflows. Probable defaults may be followed by political instability. Earlier this year, Sri Lanka was the first nation to stop paying its foreign bondholders, burdened by unwieldy food and fuel costs that fueled protests and political chaos. Populations suffering from high food prices and shortages of supplies can be a tinderbox for political instability, Barclays has said, as quoted by Bloomberg.

The head of the United Grain Company Dmitry Sergeev made the announcement during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Egypt has been the biggest client so far, and several contracts with partners in Turkey have been signed, totaling 3 billion rubles (more than $47 million), he added. ""The main thing we are striving for is to stop using intermediary international traders completely and work directly with importing countries,""Sergeev stressed. Russia is the world s top wheat exporter and President Putin said in May that this year's grain harvest could be the biggest ever, as the country is expected to harvest 130 million tons of grain, including 87 million tons of wheat. The global grain market has been badly affected by the disruption of exports from Ukraine and other major wheat producers, India and Kazakhstan. Both have banned wheat exports to ensure food security at home. The developments have led to a spike in grain prices and warnings of a global food crisis.

"3 Jul, 2022",Second woman killed by shark in Red Sea,"Local authorities have closed part of the coastline to investigate the tragedy, the Egyptian Ministry of Environment said A second woman has died as the result of a shark attack off the Red Sea coast near the Egyptian town of Hurghada, the country s Ministry of Environment said on Facebook on Sunday. Immediately upon receiving information on the shark attack on two women swimming near the resort of Sahl Hasheesh in Hurghada, Environment Minister Yasmine Fouad gave the directive to establish a working group of specialists of the Red Sea nature reserves, its statement read. News of a second victim came after a 68-year-old Austrian woman reportedly died in a shark attack. The victim apparently lost a leg and an arm and passed away due to nervous shock soon after being transferred to the private Nile Hospital in Hurghada. Experts are reviewing the circumstances of the incident to accurately determine why the shark behaved the way it did and killed two persons, the ministry said, offering its condolences to the families of the deceased. The tragedy prompted local authorities on Saturday to close part of the Red Sea coast and stop all nearby activities for three days, including diving, snorkeling, windsurfing, and kite sailing. Shark attacks are rare in the Red Sea, although one notorious incident took place in October 2020, when a 12-year-old Ukrainian boy and his tour guide lost limbs after an attack off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh. In December 2010, there were five shark assaults near the same town, which claimed the life of a German tourist and seriously injured three Russians and a Ukrainian.

"1 Jul, 2022",Salah contract saga ends as Liverpool make announcement (VIDEO),"Mo Salah's future has been determined after an announcement from the Anfield club Liverpool supporters are breathing a sigh of relief amid the news that the club's talisman Mo Salah has signed a new three-year deal to extend his stay at Anfield. The 30-year-old Egyptian superstar had just 12 months remaining on his existing contract with the former English and European champions, and his future had become the source of much debate within European football circles - with several of the continent's biggest clubs understood to have surveyed the possibility of landing him on a cut-price deal this summer, or as a free agent next year. But Salah and Liverpool drew a line through that speculation on Friday when they agreed terms to a massive £350,000 ($421,000) per week three-year contract, something which will be a significant boost to Jurgen Klopp just days out from his first-team squad reporting back to the club for preseason training. üòépic.twitter.com/3WAJeenEpy Salah, who has scored an impressive 156 goals in 254 appearances in five years with the club, celebrated the new contract, saying: I feel great and [I am] excited to win trophies with the club.

I think you can see in the last five or six years the team was always going [upwards]. Last season we were close to winning four, but unfortunately in the last week of the season we lost two trophies. I think we are in a good position to fight for everything. We have new signings as well. We just need to keep working hard, have a good vision, be positive and go for everything again.

The terms make him the best paid player in the club s history, on more than £350k a week üî¥ There were real fears within the club that Salah may opt to leave, particularly after the first round of talks late last year broke down between both parties - but the significantly improved offer, which makes him the club's highest-paid player ever, convinced him to sign up for three more years. The retention of Salah comes just days after his strike partner Sadio Mane left Liverpool to join Bayern Munich - with the prospect of losing both players in the same transfer window (or even within a year of each other) something which was likely the source of nightmares for the Liverpool faithful. Uruguay striker Darwin Nunez has been drafted in from Benfica at great expense to fill the goalscoring void left by the Senegalese. Salah and Liverpool's focus will now turn to their bid at reclaiming the Premier League crown from Manchester City, whose recent signing of Norwegian ace Erling Haaland is likely to make them an even more formidable opponent - but Liverpool, now reloaded with a content Salah, will certainly fancy their chances.

"30 Jun, 2022",China and Russia want to create G7 alternative media,"Germany s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that Beijing and Moscow hope to expand BRICS to include four more nations China and Russia want BRICS, a club of five major emerging economies, to become a counterweight to the Western-dominated Group of Seven (G7), a German newspaper has reported. To this end, Beijing and Moscow are apparently seeking to expand the group, whose other three participants are Brazil, India and South Africa. In a report on Wednesday, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung claimed that since the start of Russia s offensive against Ukraine, and the imposition of sweeping Western sanctions, Moscow has been trying to strengthen and expand its alliances with nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The Kremlin has reportedly nourished the hope of turning BRICS into an alternative to the G7 for years, after it was kicked out of the former G8. According to the German paper, the Kremlin has now doubled down on these efforts. On Monday, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced that two more nations, Argentina and Iran, had applied to join the group. On her Telegram channel, the diplomat noted that this happened while the White House was thinking what to disconnect, ban or spoil in the world. Earlier, officials in both Tehran and Buenos Aires confirmed their countries willingness to become full members. Also commenting on Telegram, Russian senator Aleksey Pushkov, who previously served as the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the State Duma, argued on Monday that although BRICS doesn t declare this, it is capable of becoming an alternative and even a counterweight to the G7 in the future as it unites the leading countries of the non-Western world. Pushkov described Iran and Argentina s bids as a breakthrough, as this not only undermines the West s efforts to isolate Russia, but also considerably expands the top economic-political organization of the non-Western world. Meanwhile, experts cited by Russia s RIA Novosti news agency claimed that ten more nations could join BRICS in future, including Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, another BRICS founding member, China, is also eager to see the club further expand. Beijing reportedly wants to invite Indonesia and Egypt to the organization. Just like Russia, China considers a bigger BRICS as a potential alternative to the Western-dominated G7, the article claims. With this goal in mind, the paper alleges, Chinese President Xi Jinping rescheduled the group s virtual summit from July 4 to June 23. Beijing reportedly wanted the meeting to start directly ahead of the G7 summit in Bavaria and the NATO summit in Madrid in late June. The report suggests that China has also invited 13 guest nations to the event to demonstrate the group s growing global influence. Among these countries are Egypt, Fiji, Algeria, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. In his address, President Xi Jinping described BRICS as a counter-project and a big family, as opposed to the US-led alliances, which he branded hegemonic, little circles. While China s Foreign Ministry announced following the summit that all BRICS member states supported the idea of expanding the group, Brazil, India and South Africa are not entirely on the same page on the matter, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung claimed.

"23 Jun, 2022",Sports court backs Russians in triumph of law over politics ,"Three Russian officials have been cleared to stand in the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) elections Russia s Maxim Agapitov has been cleared to stand for president of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in favor of his appeal against a ban. The decision also freed fellow Russians Dmitry Chernogorov and Aleksandr Kishkin to stand for positions in the IWF. The IWF s Eligibility Determination Panel (EDP) had previously said that the trio were ineligible to be nominated by the Russian Weightlifting Federation (RWF). However, in a verdict on Thursday, CAS said the panel did not have the jurisdiction to prevent them from standing. The CAS Panel in charge of the matters found that the IWF EDP did not have jurisdiction to prevent the RWF from nominating candidates for the elections, reada CAS statement. Indeed, such decision is of a disciplinary nature and, as provided by Article 13 of the IWF Constitution, it was not for the IWF EDP to rule on the suspension of the RWF in the light of Article 13.12 of the IWF Constitution, but only to determine the eligibility of the candidates in accordance with the IWF Constitution. The ruling comes ahead of IWF elections planned for this weekend at a congress in Albanian capital Tirana. Agapitov is set to stand for IWF president, general secretary treasurer, vice-president, and a position on the Executive Board. Kishkin was nominated by the RWF for a place on the IWF s Technical Committee, while Chernogorov is seeking a place on the Coaching and Research Committee. The IWF had attempted to prevent the RWF from nominating officials by citing past doping violations, also deeming officials from Thailand and Egypt ineligible. After being cleared to stand, Agapitov s inclusion would mean there are 11 contenders for the post of the IWF Presidency. Lawyer Mikhail Prokopets, who defended the interests of Agapitov and other Russian representatives, toldTASSthat Thursday s decision was the only correct outcome. We are glad that the court took into account all our arguments, he said. Frankly, we were afraid that the difficult political situation could have influenced the CAS verdict. Decisions in favor of Russians are now made very difficult, even if there are serious grounds. But we must pay tribute to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, which in this case proved the triumph of law, not politics. Agapitov, 52, is a former world and national weightlifting champion. He has headed the RWF since 2016, and he was elected to the IWF Executive Committee in 2017. Speaking on his chances at the elections, Agapitov suggested it was too early to say. It is clear that our election campaign was undermined, he toldMatch TV. I think my opponents had such a program so that we would not appear at all in the IWF elections as candidates. According toInside the Games, the upcoming vote is one of the most important in weightlifting history, after the sport was not included in the provisional program for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics due to governance concerns.

"22 Jun, 2022",Russia offers Olympics help to India,"Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin said his country would be more than willing to assist Russia would be happy to help India in the event that it wins the right to host the Olympic Games, Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin has said. India is reportedly mulling a bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics. Matytsin made the comments as he heads a Russian delegation in India at the International Convention Against Doping in Sport. We are of the opinion that the richness of any movement lies in diversity and equal opportunities for all participants in this movement, in this case the Olympic one, Matytsin toldRIA Sport. Of course, we are very happy for our colleagues from India that such a dream was born. A dream unites, it consolidates forces and demonstrates that the country has the potential not only in organizing sports competitions, because any sporting event is a complex of interaction between various structures, departments, business community... If such a dream as hosting the Olympic Games comes true, then this will be another criterion for the stable development of the country. We are always open to interaction and ready to share our experience of hosting the Olympic Games, and we have done this many times, so if a decision is made, then Russian specialists will be happy to help in organizing the Olympic Games in India. Most recently, Russia has experience of hosting the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. It also hosted another major global event in the form of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. India, which has never hosted the Olympics, had expressed interest in holding the 2032 Summer Gamesbefore it was awarded to Brisbane in Australia. Reports in Indiahave hinted at the 2036 Games as being the next target, potentially in the state of Gujarat. It is still some way off for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to announce the hosts, with a decision expected sometime between 2025 and 2029. Countries including Egypt and Indonesia have also expressed an interest. While Matytsin offered help to India, Russia itself has also floated the idea of hosting the 2036 Games in the far eastern city of Vladivostok. Earlier during his visit to New Delhi, Matytsin touted increased bilateral cooperation with India, including bypotentially popularizing cricket in Russia. India is famous for its obsession with the sport, which by contrast remains relatively unknown and little played in Russia. ",https://www.rt.com/sport/557625-russia-olympics-help-india/
"22 Jun, 2022",Saudi Arabia and Turkey seek to reset relations,"The Saudi crown prince, who is suspected of ordering the killing of a dissident in Istanbul, is paying a state visit to Turkey Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who is widely considered to be the de facto ruler of the kingdom, is visiting Turkey on Wednesday. He is to have talks with President Tayyip Erdogan in a second meeting of the two this year after a pause since the 2018 assassination of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. Ankara expects a full normalization and a restoration of the pre-crisis period, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. A new era will begin. Jamal Khashoggi was killed by a Saudi hit squad at the kingdom s consulate in Istanbul. Ankara was angered by the fact that it was indirectly dragged into a crime, which Turkish officials blamed on the senior leadership of Saudi Arabia. The perpetrators stood trial in their home country while the royal palace rejected assertions that Prince Mohammed personally ordered the hit. Riyadh claimed its security agents went rogue in Istanbul. The diplomatic rift between the two nations was partially mended in April, when Erdogan paid a visit to Saudi Arabia and met the crown prince. Amid the reconciliation process, Ankara and Riyadh toned down their mutual criticisms. At the same time Turkey announced that it was halting the trial in absentia of 26 Saudi suspects in the Khashoggi murder and transferring the case to Saudi Arabia. Observers believe that the Turkish leader is interested in Saudi assistance to boost his country s economy, which has suffered amid the global slowdown. Erdogan is facing a challenging bid to be reelected as Turkish president next year. In February, Erdogan visited the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a close ally of Saudi Arabia, for the first time in nearly a decade. Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who was then the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, went to Ankara in November last year. The UAE announced the launch of a $10 billion fund for investments into Turkey following his trip. Turkey s change of stance towards Saudi Arabia is not unlike that of the United States. President Joe Biden, who pledged on his election campaign trail to make Saudi Arabia a pariah over the murder, is set to visit the country next month. His administration is struggling to rein in the surge of gas prices in the US and seeks a boost in production by the Gulf kingdom. Prince Mohammed bin Salman paid visits to Jordan and Egypt earlier this week. ",https://www.rt.com/news/557621-mbs-erdogan-meeting-ankara/

Over 690 deals were signed during the four-day event. Despite the tense political situation regarding Russia s military operation in Ukraine, officials and businessmen from more than 130 countries took part in the forum this year, including representatives from all unfriendly states that have imposed sanctions on Russia. The forum s business program included 214 events and focused on Russian and global economic and social issues, and technology. The presidents of Egypt, China, and Kazakhstan took part in a plenary session of the forum along with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Anton Kobyakov, a Putin adviser and head of the SPIEF Organizing Committee, the forum showcased the economic sovereignty of Russia while highlighting the importance of the platform on the international level. It seems to us that the most important thing SPIEF demonstrated was Russia s self-sufficiency and economic sovereignty, and that the country is not susceptible to external pressures and blackmail, Kobyakov said. SPIEF confirmed its status as a globally sought-after platform for discussing issues of the world order. This is important, as the world has already become multipolar. Among the major deals signed at the forum this year was a technical agreement on gas supplies between Russia s main gas exporter, Gazprom, and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Gazprom and QazaqGaz agreed to increase the processing of Kazakh gas in Russia. NOVATEK announced plans to build a mini-plant for the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at its plant in the city of Togliatti in western Russia. Rosatom signed an agreement with Yakutia on the construction of a pilot mini-nuclear power plant, to be commissioned in 2030. Russia and the Donetsk People s Republic concluded agreements on trade, economic, scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation.

"17 Jun, 2022",Sanctions against Russia to remain no matter what foreign policy expert,"The EU won t change its course even if the Russia-Ukraine conflict ends, claims Valdai Club program director Ivan Timofeev The extensive sanctions placed on Moscow will most likely remain in place even if there is a ceasefire or a political resolution to the Ukrainian conflict, one of Russia s leading foreign policy analysts, Ivan Timofeev, has told RT. The expert was speaking on the sidelines of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday. Timofeev, who serves as the program director at the Kremlin-backed Valdai discussion forum, argued that the EU was a huge vessel that was very difficult to turn, and that because it had already turned away from Russia, it was difficult to imagine that things could ever go back to the way they were before February 2022, when Moscow launched its military offensive against Ukraine. According to Timofeev, the sanctions have also not yet taken their full effect. While Russia is still feeling quite good as oil prices have risen, Timofeev notes that it could still only be a matter of time before Moscow is faced with problems, unless it redirects its attention to markets in Asia, especially countries like India and China. Gas, meanwhile, is a completely different subject, says the expert, since Europe can t easily get rid of Russian gas as it has little means of getting it elsewhere and lacks the technical capabilities of receiving liquefied gas from countries like the US. Nevertheless, Timofeev stressed that Moscow should still think about strategic decisions of redirecting our gas supply on the international markets, as policy and politics will press the economy in the nearest future. After noting that energy cooperation between Russia and the West will likely be complicated for quite some time, Timofeev also stressed that food security has become an issue as international businesses are afraid of engaging with Russia. Food security is an interesting issue, noted Timofeev. In relation to Russia, sanctions are formally not covering the Russian exports of food. Formally this is a keyword. The US Department of Treasury has even issued a general license which allows businesses to conduct financial transactions even with sanctioned Russian persons if these transactions are related to food security to grain or any other kind of food. However, businesses are very scared. Businesses are convinced that it s easier to completely abandon dealings with Russia as such, rather than face the enforcement of secondary sanctions from the US. Timofeev highlighted two major problems with the export of Russian grain the decline of financial transactions related to Russian grain exports, and the refusal of vessel owners to transport the grain to countries like Egypt over the perceived threat of American sanctions. The specialist noted that this has all resulted in a paradoxical situation, where the US Treasury is trying to encourage businesses to engage in the export of Russian grain, saying It is legal, you can do this, but the businesses, looking at past experiences with US sanctions, are choosing to abstain. Timofeev concluded by stating that the current economic crisis has shown that Russia is actually quite an important player in the international economy. Before this crisis there had been numerous assessments that the Russian economy is almost nothing in the global landscape because the percentage of Russia in the global GDP is quite tiny, less than two percent, he said. But, at the same time, if you look at the reality, Russia is [the] number 11 economy. But what is more important is that Russia is critical in a number of spheres in energy, agriculture, food, arms supplies, and a number of tech chains and supply chains. In the end, the fallout from the West s sanctions against a seemingly inconsequential country like Russia, according to Timofeev, turned out to be much bigger than their linear logic had implied before. However, while the international economy will eventually get through this crisis, Timofeev surmised, it s important to understand that the current issues are the result of the accidental combination of a multitude of factors and not solely the result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Speaking at the plenary session of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), the Russian leader argued that all the current talk in the West about so-called Putin's inflation was designed for those who cannot read and write. The term has been previously used by US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

In the Russian leader s opinion, the policy of EU authorities will deepen the split in the West not only on economic matters but also on its values system. Such a detachment from reality, from the demands of society, will inevitably lead to a surge of populism and the growth of radical movements, to serious social and economic changes, to degradation, and in the near future, to a change of elites, Putin said.

Brussels hopes the agreement will help it to reduce energy dependence on Russia. The deal will see Israel sending more gas via Egypt, which has facilities to liquify it for export by sea, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said at a joint news conference alongside the Egyptian and Israeli energy ministers. In 2021, the EU imported some 40% of its gas from Russia. The heavy reliance on energy purchases from the country makes it difficult for the bloc to expand its Ukraine-related sanctions. The gas destined for European consumers is expected to go from Israel via a pipeline directly to Egypt s LNG terminal on the Mediterranean coast before being loaded onto tankers and shipped north to the European market. Some Israeli gas is already being sent by pipeline to liquefaction plants in Egypt, where it is liquefied and re-exported. Israel reportedly operates two gas fields off its Mediterranean coast holding an estimated 690 billion cubic meters of natural gas combined, while a third offshore rig is in the works. Egypt is also a gas producer, but its exports have been limited by rising domestic demand. At the same time, the country s large-scale natural gas facilities on the Mediterranean have remained mostly inactive since the country s 2011 uprising that led to the overthrow of then-President Hosni Mubarak.

"13 Jun, 2022",West pressuring Arab states top official,"Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit has claimed that the West wants to use the Middle East to surround Russia Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit in an interview on Sunday accused the West of pressuring Arab states to condemn Russia over its military operation in Ukraine and vote against Moscow in international forums, in a bid to surround Russia with compliant Middle Eastern allies. A number of Arab League members including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt voted for a UN General Assembly resolution in March voicing opposition to Russia s offensive. However, the league itself, which represents 22 Arab states, has not offered a similar view on Moscow s actions, stating in late February that it supports a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, and acknowledging that its members share close relations with the two sides in the crisis. Mediareportsat the time suggested that the US lobbied Egypt and several other countries to give their political support to Kiev and reduce the pace of their cooperation with Russia. In an interview with Egypt s Sada el-Balad TV network on Sunday, Gheit confirmed that the West had indeed pressured league members in a bid to get them on board and geopolitically surround Russia. ""They did not succumb to this dictate to which they were subjected, and some even refused to vote for condemning the actions of the Russian Federation,""Gheit stated, according to areportby the TV channel Al-Mayadeen. Of the Arab League s members, Algeria, Iran, Iraq and Sudan abstained from the final UN vote, while Syria, a Russian ally whose membership in the league has been suspended since 2011, opposed the resolution. Days before the vote, reports suggested that the UAE and Egypt would abstain. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who met with league members in April, has previously accused the West of coercing other nations to take its side in defense of the US-dominated world order. ""The formation of a multipolar world is underway, and our Western colleagues are trying to prevent these processes. They want to maintain and extend their dominance to all regions. They are trying to mobilize all other countries to come under their flag, using the situation in Ukraine and around it as a pretext,""Lavrov said after a meeting with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation last month. While most Arab League members sided with Washington during the UN s vote in March, an Arab News/YouGovpolllast month found that in 13 out of 14 Arab countries surveyed, a majority of respondents blamed the US-led NATO alliance for the conflict in Ukraine, rather than Russia. The only exception was Syria, where respondents blamed each side equally. ",https://www.rt.com/news/557099-west-pressure-arab-league-ukraine/
"11 Jun, 2022",US Congress proposes anti-Iran alliance,"Lawmakers have proposed an integrated air defense net for Israel and nine Arab countries The US should support Israel and nine Arab countries in establishing an integrated air defense system to counter Iran, according to a proposal by 10 members of Congress from both parties made public this week. Dubbed the Deterring Enemy Forces and Enabling National Defenses (DEFEND) Act, the bill would authorize the Pentagon to cooperate with Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to develop and deploy integrated air and missile defenses against the alleged threat posed by Iran. The bill enjoys the support of 10 lawmakers from both political parties. Democrats Jacky Rosen (Nevada), Cory Booker (New Jersey), Joni Ernst (Iowa), and James Lankford (Oklahoma) have introduced it in the Senate. Meanwhile, Democrats Brad Schneider (Illinois), David Trone (Maryland), and Jimmy Panetta (California) joined forces with Republicans Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Washington), Ann Wagner (Missouri), and Don Bacon (Nebraska) in the House of Representatives. Thank you for the support@JackRosenNYCand@AJCongress!It s great to see all the organizations that have rallied behind the DEFEND Act.pic.twitter.com/eMCDVUeAOR US leadership, in developing integrated air and missile defense, would provide essential security, stability, and a unified defense to the region. The DEFEND Act is a prime example of the important, bipartisan, bicameral work that Congress must prioritize in our pursuit of regional peace and stability, Rep. Schneider (D-Illinois) said in the announcement. All 10 lawmakers are members of the Abraham Accords Congressional Caucus, established earlier this year. It was named after the agreements between Israel, the UAE and Bahrain as well as Sudan and Morocco to normalize relations, signed between August and December 2020, during the term of US President Donald Trump. One possible wrinkle in the plan is that Israel currently has formal ties with only half the countries that would be involved. It is also unclear whether any of the listed countries are on board with the effort, or if the US lawmakers even consulted them, according to theTimes of Israel. The idea of a joint air defense system was reportedly floated at the meeting of foreign ministers from Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, and the UAE with the US secretary of state last March. It was also reportedly brought up in US-Saudi talks, which the State Department hopes will lead to Riyadh also joining the Abraham Accords.

"9 Jun, 2022","Alexey Grivach: With soaring energy prices, the specter of stagflation haunts the world","A full embargo on Russian energy resources is still a long way from being implemented, but difficulties are already emerging Alexey Grivach,Deputy General Director of Russia s National Energy Security Foundation The surge in energy prices, which began last year and has been reinforced by Russia s military action in Ukraine and the collective West s sanctions war against Moscow, has brought the world back to the 1970s. That was a time when stagflation raged first in Britain and then in other countries across the globe. As we look at global GDP it s hard right now to see how we avoid a recession, World Bank President David Malpass told an event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce in late May. The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself. The week before, on the sidelines of the G7 finance ministers' meeting, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged that higher food and energy prices are having stagflationary effects, namely, depressing output and spending and raising inflation all around the world. Stagflation is a contradiction from the point of view of classical economic theory, combining a sharp rise in prices and a slowdown in GDP growth. The term is attributed to Ian McLeod, a British Conservative politician who was never an economist but rather a poet, an avid bridge-player, a fine orator and who served as Health Secretary under Winston Churchill, Labour Secretary under Anthony Eden and Secretary of State for the Colonies under Harold Macmillan. In 1965, as shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, he said in a speech to the House of Commons: We now have the worst of both worlds not just inflation or just stagnation, but both. We have a kind of stagflation situation. However, the term gained real international fame after MacLeod s death, in the mid-1970s, when the developed economies faced an Arab oil embargo due to the supply of weapons to Israel during the Yom Kippur War with Egypt and Syria. Back then, due to a supply cut-off to the US, Japan, Canada and Western European countries, OPEC production dropped by 25%, global oil prices immediately quadrupled, and importing countries experienced severe fuel shortages and were forced to introduce various austerity measures, from fuel rationing to the introduction of speed limits for motor vehicles. Although the embargo was lifted five months later, oil prices continued to rise throughout the 1970s, undergoing another massive leap (two and a half times) at the end of the decade after the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Thus, the nominal price of crude rose by an order of magnitude during the 1970s, creating a new economic and political reality. What is happening now is very similar to the events of 50 years ago. However, this time an embargo on Russian energy supplies is being attempted by the consumers themselves, the same ones supplying military aid to the Ukrainian government. Incidentally, one of the consequences of the oil crises of the 1970s was the emergence of large gas pipelines from the Soviet Union to Western European states, which were seeking to reduce their dependence on Arab supplies. At that time, projects to build LNG terminals in the Arctic to supply Soviet LNG to the US were also on the agenda, with the same aim of increasing energy security through diversification of suppliers. However, the d√©tente in Soviet-American relations ended before it had even started, and in the early 1980s the Reagan administration fiercely fought against the construction of the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod gas pipeline, or, as it was called in the US media and official documents, the Siberian gas pipeline, to deliver large volumes of gas from Western Siberia to Germany, France, Italy and Austria. In general, of course, history has a tendency to repeat itself. But there are some striking differences. The fact is that energy prices began their rally long before the previously frozen conflict in the Donbass turned hot and Moscow was battered by sanctions from Brussels and Washington. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Brent crude was just over $44 per barrel, and in the last quarter of 2021, it was almost $80, growth of 80%. Accordingly, the price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States increased by 89% from $1.25 to $2.36 (EIA data for the FOB price of Regular gasoline in the New York Bay area). The spot price of gas at the American Henry Hub also increased by 89%, to $172 per thousand cubic meters ($4.77 per million British thermal units), although this index has not shown any correlation with the price of oil and gasoline for many years. But all this pales in comparison to what has been happening with energy prices in the EU over the past year. The average spot price for gas (at the Dutch TTF hub) in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1,160 per thousand cubic meters. And that is six times or 607% more than in the October to December period of 2020. The price of imported thermal coal delivered to northwest European ports increased by two and a half times (or 241%) from $66 to $160 per ton. And the cost of electricity (the day-ahead spot price in base load) in the UK, for example, jumped almost four and a half times or 439%, from £50 to £222 per MWh. This is not just energy inflation, but hyperinflation. Moreover, the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on energy prices has been very modest. In the first quarter of 2022, oil, gasoline and imported coal tariffs continued to rise in the EU. Brent crude oil, on average, exceeded $100 (up 26% on the fourth quarter of 2021), US gasoline added 19% and coal prices in Europe rose 41% amid an EU embargo, though it was postponed until August. But gas prices did not rise in the first quarter, either in the US or Europe, and electricity in the UK was even slightly cheaper, by 4%. At the same time, the upward trend was maintained over the same period last year. Meanwhile, in the US, gas prices rose sharply since April due to slow production growth, depleted storage and high demand from LNG plants, from which gas was mostly supplied to the EU. As a result, gas at the Henry Hub in the US was two-and-a-half times more expensive in April than a year ago, and 2.7 times more expensive in May. Given that spot prices in the US are directly linked to prices for power plants, industrial consumers and commercial customers (i.e. the entire market volume, except for households, which account for only 17% of the 780 billion cubic metres of total demand), a two-to-threefold increase in gas prices is a heavy burden on the entire US economy. This is despite the fact that Washington has been a net exporter of the fuel for a couple of years now. The Americans have promised to supply the whole world, including much of Europe, but they have failed to ensure that they maintain a comfortable level for themselves in times of need. Of course, the situation there is better than in Europe, where gas prices were already two to three times higher and have now jumped another five to six times. But the EU market after Brexit is 90% import-dependent, and for the bloc this price increase is an extra reason to advocate a rejection of hydrocarbons at any cost. As a result, inflation in the US reached a 41-year high of 8.5% in March, in the UK 7%, something not seen in 30 years, and in the EU in April, 7.5% on average for the bloc (a year ago it was 1.6%). Moreover, five of the 27 members reached double-digit growth, while the absolute leader Estonia-saw a 19% increase in prices. And all of these delights were already in place for the EU and US economies before the situation in Ukraine escalated. A full embargo on Russian energy is still a long way off, but difficulties with logistics and the production of related goods, such as fertilizers, are already starting to emerge and will intensify for the foreseeable future, driving up inflation, fuelling fears of energy shortages and triggering a slowdown of economic growth.

"9 Jun, 2022","Westerners are skeptical about their leaders, but not their anti-Russian narratives","A NATO-linked survey shows declining trust in Western democracies why, then, is their state propaganda still swallowed as gospel? Rachel Marsdenis a columnist, political strategist, and host of independently produced talk-shows in French and English. Rachel Marsdenis a columnist, political strategist, and host of independently produced talk-shows in French and English. Every year since 2018, the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, spearheaded by former NATO secretary general and Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, releases its survey of the current state of democracy in cooperation with the Berlin-based data firm, Latana. It bears noting up front that the ""think tank,"" besides being run by a former NATO chief, is funded by the US government, the EU and other sources, such as Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk, and aligned with the Atlantic Council, a pro-NATO lobby group. Furthermore, the survey is heavily skewed towards European states. Over 50,000respondents, in 53 countries, sounded off on the state of democracy worldwide, and the current hot global issues. Last year, the poll revealed that 46% of those living in free democracies considered their governments restrictions on freedoms amid the Covid-19 crisis to be excessive. It alsofoundthat as the pandemic progressed, an increasing number of citizens felt that their government served a select few rather than the greater good. Washington s influence was considered by 44% of respondents to be the biggest threat to democracy, compared to 28% who felt the same way about Moscow s influence, and 38% about China s. This year, the focus has shifted to assessing views towards Russia amid the Ukraine conflict, with the poll asking whether citizens of various countries want their governments to cut economic ties with Russia as a result. Of the 52 nations whose citizens were polled, 31 had a majority of respondents who were reported to be in favor of doing so. European countries represent 20 of those, with others (such as Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and the US) being close Western allies. But a glance at the responses of these same citizens of Western democracies to the question of how democratic they think their own country is,suggests deep disappointmentin their own gatekeepers. Only 49% of Americans think that their country is democratic, 61% of Britons, 62% of Canadians, 44% of Greeks, 44% of Poles, 53% of Italians, 63% of Germans, 54% of Belgians, and 47% of French. By contrast, 83% of Chinese reported feeling that they live in a democracy. Western citizens also consider corruption and the global influence of corporations two things that are within the power of current Western governments to mitigate and control to be significant threats to their democracies. Given that faith in democracy has manifestly eroded so shockingly under the recent leadership of these countries, its puzzling as to why their citizens would nonetheless trust the conventional and typically skewed Western establishment anti-Russian narrative, which has taken various forms over the years from election interference hysteria to the ludicrous notion that Russia s military action in Ukraine was unprovoked. The list of the 20 countries whose citizens don t support cutting economic ties with Russia holds a few clues as to what may be going on: Greece, Kenya, Turkey, China, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, Algeria, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, Morocco, Malaysia, Peru, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. The people of Greece have been divided on the issue of anti-Russian EU sanctions from the get-go, with 66% of Greeks believing that a distinction should be made between the Russian government and the Russian people, according toa Eurobarometer surveyfrom early May. The poll also indicated that Greeks are untrusting and perhaps more than other European and Western citizens of European and national authorities regarding information about the conflict, as well as journalists, social media, and NGOs. Meanwhile, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) has resisted falling into lockstep with his North American allies anti-Russian narratives and has generally taken more of a non-aligned approach to this and other issues. Hungary has done much the same within the EU, while Morocco and Turkey, also on the list, have taken a similar nonaligned stance vis-a-vis their close allies in Europe. There s no denying the impact and influence of a top-down anti-Russian narrative with which aligned Western nations constantly bombard their citizens. The survey evidence also seems to suggest that this propaganda despite its prevalence in the worldwide press and on social media can be mitigated by national leaders adopting and communicating more pragmatic and less extremist and radicalized positions. The big mystery, however, is why citizens of some countries are less inclined to question the Western establishment s anti-Russian narrative in light of their growing general mistrust of these very same governing powers. We re on the verge of a global polarization over crises like Covid and Ukraine, as citizens around the world fall into two camps:liberal democraciesthat are successfully propagandized and radicalized into believing the narratives that they re spoon-fed in support of a political-industrial complex that derives benefit from mass public support or complacency, versus those around the world who aren t willing to settle for soundbites and spin lines as a substitute for independent critical thought.",https://www.rt.com/russia/556770-west-anti-russia-propaganda/
"9 Jun, 2022",Likely delays in arms supply to Ukraine revealed,"Software upgrades, logistical and diplomatic problems may slow supplies from Germany, media reports Ukraine is likely to be further disappointed with the supply of heavy weapons promised to it by Germany, as Berlin will have to overcome various hurdles before delivering many of the items, the German version of Business Insider hasreported. The offer of the IRIS-T SL air defense system, touted by Chancellor Olaf Scholz as one of the most advanced in the German arsenal, reportedly came as a surprise to his own defense ministry. Officials said they none in their stockpile, meaning Ukraine would have to get them directly from Diehl, the producer, the outlet claimed. According to BI sources, the proposed delivery would require Germany to snub Egypt, which ordered several IRIS-T SLs and allow Ukraine jump the line. Regardless, Kiev will only be able to acquire the equipment by the end of the year at best. The German arms package for Ukraine also includes a three-way deal with Greece, which is to get German Marder infantry fighting vehicles in exchange for delivering Soviet-made equivalents to Ukraine. The Greeks were reportedly surprised by Scholz s announcement of the scheme. The Soviet-era vehicles are in use on their islands and replacing them with more modern German hardware may be perceived as an escalation by Turkey, BI said. Athens also wants to have the entire order of 50 Marders delivered before relinquishing its old machines to Ukraine, the report said. The proposed arrangement also reportedly pulled the rug from under the producer of the armor, the German arms giant Rheinmetall, which hoped it could sell the Marders directly to Ukraine. Germany also wants to supply Kiev with several MARS IIs an EU version of the US-made M270 MLRS. But according to BI, the goal to have the multiple rocket launchers shipped by the end of June may prove to be unrealistic. The outlet s sources said that less than half of the 40 launchers operated by the German military are currently in working condition. And even if the Bundeswehr was willing to part with some of them, their software would need to be upgraded first. The EU launchers use an Airbus-designed fire control system that s not compatible with some types of rockets used by version from outside the bloc. A reverse conversion will be required to allow Ukrainians to fire ammunition supplied by the US and the UK. But the process of upgrading the software may take months, the outlet said. BI assessed that most of the weapons promised to Ukraine by Germany will not be coming anytime soon, with the exception of Flakpanzer Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns. It said 15 of those could arrive by mid-July and 15 more by the end of August. However, they will come with just 59,000 rounds, BI said. Each system has two guns with a combined rate of fire of 1,100 rpm and normally carries 680 total rounds. Officials in Kiev have repeatedly berated Germany and Chancellor Scholtz personally for what they call insufficient military support of their country against Russia. The disdain apparently was fueled by last month s announcement that Berlin was planning to invest 100 billion euros into rearming and enlarging its military.

"8 Jun, 2022","The story of when Israel attacked America, and the US government sided with Tel Aviv","RT remembers the story of USS Liberty, an American battleship attacked by Israeli forces in 1967 Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . On June 8, 1967, Israel attacked an American intelligence ship named the USS Liberty. The incident left two-thirds of the ship s crew dead or injured, in an intentional assault by the Israeli military, yet the US government s response was to move on and become closer with Tel Aviv. It could be argued that this set a precedent for Israel to kill US citizens with impunity. It was four days into the Six-Day War. Israel had occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, defeated the Jordanian military, crushed the Egyptians, and was having success against Syria. Tel Aviv had told the US it would be a limited war, in which it would not pursue the seizure of areas such as the Syrian Golan Heights or Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. However, Israel was poised to do just that. Floating in the international waters of the Mediterranean, off the coast of Egypt, a state-of-the-art American ship carrying around 300 crewmen was stationed to gather intelligence that was key to Washington's interests in the region. It was during the Cold War, and Israel was taking on three of the most problematic Middle East allies of the Soviet Union: Egypt, Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The conflict, about to end in just a few days time, would reshape the region in the West s favor and earn Tel Aviv its position as one of America s top allies. The Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, often painted as Israel s battle for American interests, was not exactly as clean cut as this narrative suggests. At 2pm on June 8, Israeli ground control commanded its fighter jets to attack the USS Liberty, a clearly marked US shipflying a large American flag. This was a vessel thatIsrael had identified at least seven times, according to audiotapes uncovered by Al-Jazeera as belonging to the US Navy. The Israeli military opened fire with armor-piercing rounds, striking the ship. They also dropped napalm, gunned down the lifeboats, and shot a torpedo into the ship. A total of 34 Americans were killed and 172 were wounded as a result of the unprovoked attack. Survivors of the USS Liberty havecompiled evidenceto argue that it should be tried as a war crime. Despite clear calls for a comprehensive investigation that would bring those who ordered the assault to justice, USS Liberty survivors say their pleas have never been followed through on and, until this day, much of the documentation surrounding the incident is still deemed classified by the US government. The cover-up Shortly after the incident occurred, President Lyndon Johnson's administration was informed in full. Israel announced its official position, admitting that it was a deliberate assault, but that their forces had misidentified the ship and the entire episode was a huge mistake. This position was not immediately accepted by the US but Johnson never followed through with a thorough investigation. It is due to the sheer scale of censorship surrounding the incident, the lack of accountability and absence of a proper inquiry, that many survivors of the USS Liberty attack claim there has been a cover-up and continue to demand justice 55 years later. Many US military, intelligence and civilian officials have alsodisputed Israel s claimthat it wasn t aware it was an American ship. Among them was the US secretary of state at the time, Dean Rusk, who stated in his autobiography, As I Saw It , that I didn t believe them then, and I don t believe them to this day. The attack was outrageous. The Israeli military, shortly afterwards, broughtsix chargesagainst a number of those who had been involved. However,they were later droppedby military judge Sgan-Aluf I. Yerushalmi, who concluded in the preliminary inquiry that in all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of any one of the naval officers concerned in this incident cannot be considered unreasonable, to an extent which justified commital for trial. Eye-witness testimonies were later left out of the American report, discarded by the US government. In addition to this,key evidence disappearedand the survivors, in addition to family members of the victims, were silenced from speaking to the press for fear that it would inflame US-Israeli relations. There was never a formal hearing in the US Congress about the incident, which was called unprecedented and a national disgrace, by former US admiral Thomas Moorer. Moorer also went on to state that US forces were ordered to stand down by Secretary of Defense McNamara and President Johnson for reasons the American public deserved to know. The captain and crew of the Liberty, rather than being widely acclaimed as the heroes they most certainly are, have been silenced, ignored, honored belatedly and away from the cameras, and denied a history that accurately reflects their ordeal. The US media was all but silent on the USS Liberty story when it happened, in terms of it having been a potentially intentional Israeli attack, or even on the scale of the incident. However, Newsweek published a piece in which they cited a senior official at the White House claiming to have believed that Israel intentionally targeted the ship. It was soon thereafter discovered that Johnson was Newsweek s source, and this enraged Israel and its lobbyists in Washington alike. If the president didn t alter his position, the Israel lobby was allegedly preparing a campaign that would accuse him of blood libel and paint him as an anti-Semite. This line of argument would suggest that Johnson may have sought to find the truth, but cared more for the votes of the Jewish community in the United States and feared being painted as against their cause. Israel also provided another incentive for the US president to change his approach to the issue and drop the thought of pursuing it further in the form of a considerable political gift. At the time, Johnson was facing considerable backlash following his role in continuing the Vietnam War. This was a huge diplomatic headache, especially at a time when the North Vietnamese forces had recently acquired Soviet surface-to-air missiles. Everyday, US aircraft were being shot out of the sky by these missiles, meaning the American death toll was steadily increasing a problem for which Israel had the answer. Through Israel s successful ground offensive in the Egyptian Sinai, it hadgotten its hands on the same Soviet missiles and the manuals for their usage. Tel Aviv decided to hand them over to the US as a gift, along with the instructions. To both the US and Israel, the Six-Day War was a major triumph. For the Americans, this was a major victory against their Soviet enemy and, for Israel, this was its golden moment when it had just defeated its neighbors and become the darling of the West. The USS Liberty story getting out to the press was just too big of a speed bump and would have negatively impacted the results achieved by both parties, if the American public were to discover what truly transpired. Why did Israel attack America? There are four primary explanations as to why Israel attacked the USS Liberty, making the truth hard to decisively pin down and it is likely that it could be any of these four reasons, or in fact a mixture. There is also the Israeli narrative, which says the attack was a mistake. The first explanation is that Israel had sold its American allies the lie that it was only fighting a limited war and weren t seeking a land grab. Tel Aviv had clear plans to seize not only the Sinai Peninsula, but also toGolan Heights, which it would hold after the war as its territory, along with the entirety of historic Palestine. This line of thinking suggests Israel feared that the American intelligence ship may have caused unwanted trouble if it were to find any information on Tel Aviv s true intentions. The second and third explanations have to do with more easily observable Israeli war crimes that the vessel could have picked up on, including the massacre of 14UN peacekeepersin the Gaza Strip and themass murder of around 1,000 Egyptian prisoners of war in the Sinai. The USS Liberty was reportedly in close proximity to the city of El-Arish, where Israeli forces would go on to line up and gun down Egyptian POWs. It is believed that at least 400 captives were killed in El-Arish alone by Israeli forces. The fourth explanation, which stemmed primarily from aBBC investigative documentary, released back in 2012, was that the attack could have been a false-flag operation gone wrong. This points to the involvement of US intelligence officials, who are said to have discussed the possibility of a joint US-Israeli operation to sink an American ship in order to blame it on the Egyptians. The evidence on this is not conclusive, but would lead us to believe that both US and Israeli intelligence were seeking aGulf of Tonkinstyle pretext to launch a joint war against Egypt. Although this should not be completely ruled out as a possibility, opponents of this line of thinking argue that Israel was already easily beating all of its neighbors without the aid of the US and that it would make little sense for Washington to provide a pretext for a Soviet intervention. Interestingly, in 2017, The Intercept released two classified National Security Agency (NSA) documents which shed more light on the incident. One of the documents,a classification guide that was in use until at least 2006, revealed that the NSA had its own Hebrew transliteration system. However, the guide states that this information is secret and hence we aren t able to conclude exactly what evidence this would present. The Intercept article states that this proves the US has historically consideredIsrael an intelligence target. Until this day, the NSA refuses to acknowledge that it intercepted Israeli signals that day, a claim contradicted by aninvestigative report released by the Chicago Tribune. The reason the question of the NSA s potential intelligence targeting of Israel is so important is because it helps bolster the theory that Israel knew they were attacking an American ship. It may also give us reason to believe the argument made by Russian author, Joseph Daichman, in his book History of the Mossad , which says Israel attacked the Liberty to stop the Soviets from stealing US-intercepted intelligence. Daichman argues that Israel was justified in attacking the ship, as failure to do socould lead to the Soviets providing the Egyptians with sensitive intelligence informationthat was vital to the war effort. US-Israeli relations and the killing of Americans with impunity No one was ever found guilty of the USS Liberty incident. In 1968, the year following the June 1967 war, theUS aid budget for Israel was expanded by 450%and Tel Aviv had grown closer to the US than ever before. No future US government would ever pursue accountability for the murder of 34 unarmed US citizens. The bottom line was that Israel s position as a key US ally was more important than American lives and, since the story never did rounds in the US media, there was little protest over what had occurred. In March 2003, another high-profile case of Israel targeting an American citizen occurred. This time, an Israeli soldier driving a militarized bulldozer in the southern Gaza Strip was responsible for killing a young woman named Rachel Corrie. The 23-year-old American woman was clearly identifiable and was attempting to prevent the demolition of Palestinian homes by Israeli forces. After years of her parents fighting for justice through the legal system, anIsraeli court found its soldier not guilty in 2012and that was that. The US government didn t lift a finger for young Corrie, who was brutally crushed to death. Just over a month ago, a veteran Palestinian-American journalist named Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead by an Israeli soldier, intentionally so,according to the results of a CNN investigative report. The US State Department initially claimed that it trusted its Israeli allies to investigate what would amount to a war crime, remaining silent on what the US itself would do to ensure accountability. Israel laterdeclared that it would not investigate the killingof Shireen Abu Akleh and that, even in the event of one of its soldiers being responsible, theywouldn t be liable for any criminal misconduct. It would seem, based upon the evidence before us, that President Joe Biden's team are following the same ""rules| that has existed since 1967 of never punishing Israel no matter what, even if it is responsible for murdering US citizens. The line of thinking here is that US aid to Israel is unconditional and that support for Tel Aviv never wanes, no matter what Tel Aviv does.",https://www.rt.com/news/556787-israel-uss-liberty-incident/
"6 Jun, 2022",The untold story behind the fall of the Middle East s largest private equity company,"RT correspondent spoke to Arif Naqvi, an entrepreneur accused of stealing from some of the most powerful powerful people on Earth and facing 291 years in US prison ByLubna Hamdan It s a chilly day in London. I arrive at a members-only club in Mayfair. I m about to have a meeting I ve been waiting to make happen for nearly two years. It s with Arif Naqvi. He s the man accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the world s most powerful elite through his Middle Eastern private equity company, the now-defunct Abraaj Group. I scan the venue s buzzing drawing room when my eyes land on a frail figure sitting in a quiet corner by a window. If it weren t for his famously thick and swept back silver hair, I wouldn t have recognized him. It s been at least a few years since we d last met. Naqvi s casual attire a navy blue sweater and jeans long enough to cover his ankle bracelet (courtesy of house arrest) is a stark contrast to the sharp suits he sported every day, for nearly 40 years. Arif Naqvi is telling our entrepreneurs that they have an advantage that Silicon Valley doesn t have They know the region and the consumers! entrepreneurship summit RiseUp said of Naqvi in 2017. Abraaj Group is a beacon savvy investors who want double digit returns like that should take note, an entrepreneur said of the company in the same year. He told me, I m going to take a boy from you, and return him to you a man, Naqvi s friend said as he recounted the day his son began a career with Abraaj. He was a very generous guy on a personal level and with his staff, said another. He loved life. And how could Naqvi not love life when he was credited with turning Abraaj, which he set up in 2002, into one of the world s top 20 private equity companies, and the leading investor in growth markets, managing a staggering $14 billion in assets across Africa, Asia, Latin America, Turkey and the Middle East, with investments in healthcare, clean energy, transportation, education and real estate. Bill Gates, Barack Obama and John Kerry are just a few of the figures Naqvi convinced to recognize the potential of emerging markets, which he called growth markets, with the purpose of doing good, while making money. It's hard to believe that just a few years later, in 2018, he would be known, instead, for the collapse of the Middle East s largest private equity company and arrested on suspicion of defrauding US investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Today he faces extradition to the US, where he would stand trial for 16 counts of fraud and money laundering, including misleading investors and auditors by covering up a $400 million shortfall across two funds by temporarily borrowing money to produce financial statements; changing financial statements to avoid disclosing a $200 million shortfall; and borrowing $350 million for Abraaj from an individual Abraaj shareholder and friend to make the company appear solvent. Naqvi doesn t appear to be loving life as much these days. There s a certain air of despair about him, and I notice that our chocolate croissant and sweet Danish remain untouched throughout our conversation. He is only allowed two hours of outdoor time a day, according to the terms of his bail, so we leave Little House and head back to his Knightsbridge apartment through Hyde Park. He suggests we take a shortcut by crossing at a busy junction. Are you scared? he asks. No, let s do it, I say. And I get a glimpse of the mild acts of rebellion Naqvi is so famous for, like the time he was caught smoking in his school s common room and got reprimanded for it. I catch a hint of a smile on his face as we run to the other side, and for a moment, he appears almost childlike. I wonder if those seemingly insignificant acts of rebellion are what bring him the slightest bit of comfort and feeling of freedom these days. Perhaps it is that same defiant spirit that led him to investing in the region s troubled markets, where few dared to venture. Indeed, I had traveled to London to meet the man accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. But I leave having met a man who s had something of his own stolen: his life story. Google the name Arif Naqvi and you ll certainly find an endless stream of sensationalised headlines: A financial fairytale: how one man fooled the global elite, The Guardian; He Convinced the Elite He Invested for Good. Then the Money Vanished, Wall Street Journal; How a Pakistani con man robbed $100 million from Bill Gates, New York Post. Dig a little deeper and you ll find they all have one thing in common: they would make for excellent Netflix productions. There s even a book written by Wall Street Journal reporters Simon Clark and Will Louch,The Key Man, which claims a former Abraaj accountant slept with a knife by his bed, while another IT executive checked for bombs under his car. The two British men had to tread carefully and there were moments when they feared for their lives. Arif remained a powerful man, the dramatized book states. It raised a few questions in my mind, like whether it was their lives the two men feared for, or their lifestyles. After all, Naqvi was known for paying his employees (both senior and junior) high salaries and generous bonuses, with the lowest paid associates at Abraaj Group pocketing $120,000 a year, according to HR firm Emolument. The book goes further to liken working for Abraaj as more traumatic than being shot at or bombed, though I can t imagine it was too traumatizing for employees to receive that SMS from their banks notifying them of their latest bonuses making their way into their accounts. This is even more surprising given the long tenures that the majority of directors, managing directors and partners had enjoyed whilst being employed at Abraaj. However, there are aspects of the book that draw parallels to real life in the way that Naqvi has been portrayed in the media following the downfall of Abraaj. Nearly every character mentioned is depicted as a victim of Naqvi s. Staffers were driven to tears by the pressure to drink, the book claims, with executives renaming Abraaj Hotel California after the Eagles song lyrics: You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave . Except employees could have left, and many did, despite Clark and Louch insinuating staff were too bullied by Naqvi to quit. With 400 employees to personally bully at Abraaj itself, this feels like storytelling for the movies. Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, Abraaj s former managing partner who was arrested in New York and pleaded guilty to seven counts of an indictment against him, including extortion and securities fraud charges wanted to leave the company, according to the book, but Naqvi allegedly pressured him to stay through a strange combination of bullying and kindness .Strange, indeed. It is either that Arif had some sort of supernatural ability to get anyone to do whatever he liked, or that employees had such little self-control. Abdel-Wadood is himself a well-connected man, with his former boss Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris having been one of the guarantors for his $10 million bail bond, according to theWall Street Journal. Abdel-Wadood said in court, My commitment to Abraaj compromised the integrity of my judgement, and I ended up drifting from who I really am. But who is Mustafa Abdel-Wadood? Was he Naqvi s victim? He was certainly his neighbor. The two lived in the same luxurious gated community, Emirates Hills, in Dubai. According to a former Abraaj employee, when Abdel-Wadood wasn t hosting parties for hundreds of people at his massive villa, he was inviting friends on a 90ft yacht called Caramel. And yet, his attorney claimed in court, This is a tragic story of a good man who stayed at Abraaj to try to rectify the madness that Arif Naqvi created and along the way participated in the wrongful conduct that he has acknowledged today . Abdel-Wadood, who spent his first few nights in the same jail as the infamous former drug lord El Chapo, could be sentenced to 125 years. But fate appears to be kinder to him, as he cooperates with US authorities for a lighter sentence in return for helping to build a case against Naqvi. But what exactly was Abdel-Wadood s role in Abraaj? His acquaintance tells us: All this act of, Oh, I m just a poor guy caught in the middle of this, is ridiculous. All the way going back to 2007, when I was working in publishing, he was demanding to be on the cover of our magazine and to get an award at one of our ceremonies. I went to my boss and said, Hang on a minute, why is this guy getting a cover and an award? and my boss said to me, You don t understand, this guy s the main man at Abraaj. He just doesn t get any credit. Arif gets all the credit . Another person who knows the Egyptian s told me, ""you d think a guy who was working with Naguib Sawiris would know exactly what he was doing at Abraaj. Another figure whose exact role in Naqvi s role appears to be muddied is ex-Abraaj managing partner Sev Vettivetpillai, who faces nine counts of criminal activities and 115 years in jail and who changed his non-guilty plea to a guilty one to get less jail time through a bargain with the US authorities against Naqvi and allegedly felt the sting of his conscience even as he conspired with Arif, according to the book. While the media describes Naqvi as the mastermind behind a global criminal conspiracy, under his leadership, the investors as well as the employees enjoyed market beating returns. Some of its success stories include a UAE water treatment company, an Omani insurer, a Qatari financial services company, and a Jordanian internet company all of which sold on to generate a total of $81 million in profit, triple the amount Abraaj invested to buy them. Even Fadi Ghandour s logistics crown jewel Aramex doubled its sales under Abraaj s ownership to $232 million, while profit quadrupled to $20 million in just four years. In 2005 when Abraaj sold its shares in the company on the Dubai stock exchange, it received $86 million, over five times the $15 million it had invested. Hundreds of Aramex employees owning stock options shared a $14 million payout. Abraaj also paid investors a $600 million dividend after buying a quarter of EFG Hermes in 2006 for $505 million and selling the shares over a year later for double the price of $1.1 billion. Other successful Abraaj investments include shares in construction company Arabtech, as well as Turkish hospital chain Acibadem, which Abraaj sold to Malaysian and Singaporean investors for a $355 million profit. Moreover, Abraaj sold its shares in Integrated Diagnostics Holdings (IDH), which operated medical-testing clinics in Egypt, in an IPO on the London Stock Exchange in 2015, after it doubled the size of IDH s network of clinics. Under Abraaj s ownership, it not only survived the strains of the Arab Spring, it thrived in spite of them. An investment banker who prefers to remain anonymous for the purpose of this article told me, Financial markets are war zones. They attack people when they lose money and forget the times they made money. Abraaj made exits at enormous realised profits to its investors even though Silicon Valley is built on overvaluations before realisations occur. Startups spend money before they make profit. Abraaj was on the verge of takeoff, he said. And while the world may know who benefited from the rise of Abraaj, the question the media and the authors ofThe Key Manfailed to address is, who benefited from the fall of Abraaj? Certainly not Naqvi, whose extradition to the US has been adjourned by a judge due to concerns of his having intermittent thoughts of not wanting to be alive, according to court documents. If Naqvi is to be extradited to the US, he will be prosecuted under a US law created to prosecute criminal gangs like the mafia. If found guilty, he faces what is effectively a life sentence; 291 years in a US federal prison. It s a harsher sentence than that of the UK and US most notorious criminals, such as disgraced English tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, or American fraudster Bernie Madoff, who ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, worth around $64.8 billion. Naqvi s bail was also bizarrely set at ¬£15 million, the highest in the UK s judicial history, whilst Lynch s bail was set at ¬£1 million. The Englishman, who inflated the price of his company to $11 billion ahead of its sale to a US conglomerate, made $800 million from the deal. Even the infamous Madoff ""only"" got sentenced to 150 years in prison compared to Naqvi s potential 291 years, while Lynch s sentence amounts to a lenient 20 years in comparison. So, what warrants Naqvi s alleged crimes being punished twice as harsh as others? US defense attorney Michael Baldassare who was hired by Naqvi s lawyers to give his expert opinion said Naqvi is unlikely to be granted bail in US courts, where federal judges are a law unto themselves. There s also the theory that, according to the same financial analyst who asked to remain anonymous, US companies were looking to capture market share by buying Abraaj s assets for cents on the dollar. A relevant prediction was voiced by Khalid Howladar, managing director and founder of risk and regulatory advisory firm Acreditus, in 2019. He said. there are probably some attractive assets on the [Abraaj] balance sheet and a sale of one or more of these over 2019 is likely, according toThe Nationalnewspaper. Some of the companies who bid for Abraaj include two of America s most powerful and politically connected private equity firms, Thomas Barrack s Colony Capital and Stephen Feinberg s Cereberus Capital Management, which offered $125 million to buy Abraaj. It later canceled its offer, along with Colony Capital, and submitted new, lower bids. By backing out at the last minute, they effectively opened the door to piecemeal sales which were also grabbed fund-by-fund by Western private equity firms, the same financial analyst told me. Even Obama s former commerce secretary Penny Pritzker entered a bid to buy Abraaj through a group she said had significant relationships at the highest levels of government and the private sector which, as you know, can be critical to unlocking opportunities for growth in emerging markets, according toThe Key Manbook. It begs the question, why would the ex-commerce secretary of the former US president be interested in a Middle East company like Abraaj? Unless Naqvi had built something so valuable that executives at the highest levels of the US government had their eyes on, even after its collapse. All of the bids to buy Abraaj as a firm fell through, so the liquidators ended up breaking it up and selling off pieces of it, and for cents on the dollar, my sources told me. According to The Key Man book, buying Abraaj s operations could give the companies footholds in new markets across Africa, Asia and Latin America. It claims that their interest in buying Abraaj ironically confirmed Naqvi s argument that growth markets (as he liked to call them), represented the future. And so, I bid goodbye to a man who may spend the rest of his days in a 6ft by 8ft prison cell. Today is a chilly day in London. However, I opt out of taking a cab back to my hotel and decide to walk instead. I have a new appreciation for freedom.",https://www.rt.com/news/556692-abraaj-group-investment-arif-naqvi/
"5 Jun, 2022",Robert Inlakesh: How Israel s 1967 war paved the way for the turmoil in today's Middle East,"On the anniversary of the Six-Day War, RT looks at how the conflict shaped the region Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . Robert Inlakeshis a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK. He has reported from and lived in the Palestinian territories and currently works with Quds News. Director of Steal of the Century: Trump's Palestine-Israel Catastrophe . On the 5th of June, 1967, a conflict which lasted only six days would go on to re-shape the entire Middle East, overthrow secular Arab Nationalism and unite Tel Aviv with Washington. All of which would pave the way for Israel to be handed carte blanche by the world's most powerful country and prompt a US policy that would go on to tear the entire region to pieces. The Six-Day War of 1967 is often misconstrued in popular Western discourse as having represented a victory for liberal democracy. Often presented as a battle between good and evil, the Jewish David and Arab Goliath, the real story of the third Arab-Israeli war was one of a shrewd, but brutal, political power play on the part of Israel. One that for better, or for worse, caused a re-structuring of Middle Eastern resistance to the West, as well as of the US-led bloc's policy in the region. Israel based its argument for what it deemed a necessary and pre-emptive war on Cairo s decision to amass its military forces in the Sinai Peninsula, and Egyptian President Gamal Abdul-Nasser s announcement that he would close the Gulf of Aqaba. These events were enough to convince many that Tel Aviv genuinely feared a military offensive coordinated by President Nasser, with the participation of Syria. Damascus had also re-enforced its military presence near the border, with Soviet backing. The reality was, however, that Egypt was engaged in a grueling war in Yemen, deploying three quarters of its military into the country and had lost nearly 10,000 men in the process. It was so catastrophic for Nasser that the intervention there was later referred to by historians as Egypt s Vietnam. The Egyptian president clearly wasn t ready to confront Israel and had amassed his troops in the Sinai as a show of force, in order to save face at a time when he faced pushback over the other conflict. As for the closure of the Gulf of Aqaba,Nasser never properly followed throughon blocking the Straits of Tiran and despite the rhetoric, they were never closed for much more than a day. Come June 5, 1967, Israel launched Operation Focus , an aerial attack which wiped out the near entirety of Egypt s air force in a matter of minutes, ensuring what would become an overwhelming victory for the Israelis. Prior to the war, the assessment previously offered to Israel, by US President Lyndon Johnson, was that US intelligence believed that the United Arab Republic (Egypt) would not attack, and that if it did, Israel would whip the hell out of them. Leonid Brezhnev, then leader of the Soviet Union, hadstated in a brief, prior to the Six-Day War of 1967, that Israel had received huge amounts of armaments from the West. Brezhnev went on to express his government's fear that the weakening of Arab nations could lead to the collapse of the anti-Colonialist movement in the Middle East. Following the war, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Palestine had been decisively defeated. However, it didn't stop the anti-Colonialist movement in the Middle East, but instead paved the way for its reformation. The US was thrilled with Israel's defeat of its Arab neighbors and considered the war to have served its own interests in putting Nasser in his place and weakening Soviet allies. Washington now valued Israel as an essential part of its Cold War strategy against the USSR. What ensued was the inevitable tightening of the Israel-US relationship, which paved the way for the alliance we see today. Israel had earned its place amongst Western Nations andwould go onto aid in implementing the subsequent Kissinger Doctrine that the US would employ in the Middle East. The 1967 victory was a stunning one for Israel, cementing its place in the region, but it also represented a catastrophe for the Arabs, known as the Naksa (Setback). Over300,000 Palestinians had been forced from their homeland, as Israel occupied the entirety of historic Palestine, in addition to the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and the Syrian Golan Heights. Furthermore, the war had largely defeated secular Arab Nationalism and represented a death blow to the Egyptian President s brand of it, known as Nasserism. Up until that point, the most popular political ideologies in the Middle East had been Arab Nationalism, Socialist Pan-Arabism and Communism. The Egyptian President, who would die of a heart attack a few years later in 1970, wasthe primary influencer of Arab revolutionariesthat existed in the region. With the perceived failure of Arab Nationalism, there would then emerge a number of competitor ideologies with which Arab movements and leaders would choose to fight their enemies. The most prominent of which would later become revolutionary Islamism, something that Nasser had actually helped to suppress, as it manifested itself in the form of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. As for Palestine, the future negotiations for Palestinian statehood would go on to be based upon reclaiming the 22 percent of the country the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip that Israel occupied during the 1967 war. Israel would emerge as major power that would primarily serve a US agenda in the region and could act at that point, seemingly, with impunity against its enemies. Today,over 1,000 Palestinians are being forced out of their homes, as Israeli forces bulldoze a collection of West Bank villages known as Masafer Yatta. This is the single largest act of ethnic cleansing, ordered by Tel Aviv against Palestinians,since the 1967 war. The position that the US began to take in 1967, unconditional support for Israel, hasn't changed and the country's utility for Washington's agenda in the region, and its powerful lobby in America, means its human rights violations are ignored. Therefore, 55 years after the Six-Day War, there is no barrier to Tel Aviv's behaviour, and it seems to have a free pass to deal with its enemies in whatever manner it chooses, even if that ends up contradicting US policy.

"4 Jun, 2022",Grain prices fall after Putin pledge,"The drop to two-month lows comes after the Russian president s statement on Ukrainian exports Global grain prices have fallen to April levels following Russian President Vladimir Putin s promise to ensure the safe export of Ukrainian grain through Black Sea ports controlled by Russia. Wheat was trading at $10.4 per bushel (27.2kg) on Friday, data from the Chicago Board of Trade shows. That was its lowest price since April 7, when it was quoted at $10.2 per bushel, and a 10% drop from its peak price in mid-May. Prices of corn for animal fodder were also down this week, falling to $7.27 per bushel. Grain prices rose last month on fears that Russia s ongoing military operation would prevent Ukraine's grain exports from reaching buyers. Western countries accused Russia of impeding exports, but Moscow has repeatedly stated that it is not to blame and that the ships carrying Ukrainian grain are unable to leave ports due to mines placed in the area by Kiev s forces. Putin on Friday once again said that Russia is in no way responsible for holding up shipments and promised to assist in the ships passage. As for the export of Ukrainian grain, we do not interfere with this It was not we who mined the passages to the ports. Ukraine mined them. I have already told all of our colleagues many times: [Ukraine] should clear the mines and allow the ships with grain leave the ports. We guarantee peaceful passage without any problems, Putin said during an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel. He also noted that there are several other ways to export grain, including via the ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol, which are under Russia s control, or via the Danube River, through Hungary, Poland or Belarus. Fears over the fate of Ukrainian grain have led to warnings of food insecurity and hunger in the past weeks, especially in poorer nations. According to Coldiretti, Italy s association representing agricultural producers, Ukrainian ships must be allowed to move from ports as soon as possible, especially as the country s warehouses will soon need to accommodate the new harvest. The departure of ships from the ports of the Black Sea means the emptying of Ukrainian warehouses where over 20 million tons of grain including wheat, barley and corn destined for exports are stored The [ship] blockade raises risks of riots and famine, Coldiretti said in a statement published on its website on Friday. Ukraine ranks sixth among the world s wheat exporters. Together, Russia and Ukraine supply nearly 30% of the wheat exported globally. According to Coldiretti, countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh and Iran buy more than 60% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine, while Lebanon, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan are also heavily dependent on supplies from the two countries.

"1 Jun, 2022",German army doesn t have weapons promised to Ukraine official,"The German military does not possess the weapons system Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to Kiev, the Defense Ministry says The German Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that it could not provide details on Chancellor Olaf Scholz s pledge to supply Ukraine with a certain air defense system. The reason cited being that the Bundeswehr the nation s armed forces does not have the weapon in stock. The weapon in question, IRIS-T, can be deployed as a short-range air-to-air missile, or a ground-based short-range or medium-range air defense system. When asked which system Berlin plans to send Kiev, Defense Ministry spokesman, Naval Captain David Helmbold, replied that this question should be ultimately addressed to the [defense] industry since we do not have these systems in our service. He added that he could not clarify the issue as the Bundeswehr does not possess such systems in its arsenal. The comment came just hours after Scholz told the parliament that his government planned to send more advanced systems to Ukraine, including an IRIS-T system and counter-battery radars capable of detecting artillery fire and pinpointing the source location. The chancellor did not elaborate whether he meant air-to-air missiles or ground-based systems. The only IRIS-T systems the Bundeswehr doeshavein its arsenal are air-to-air missiles mounted on its Eurofighter and Tornado fighters. The system, designed to replace the US AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, was developed by companies from several nations, including Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Greece among others. In Germany, IRIS-T isproducedby the Diehl arms manufacturer, which offers both air-to-air missiles and ground-based systems. Regarding potential deliveries to Ukraine, Helmbold said that when Scholz spoke about the most modern air defense system in Germany, he might not have necessarily meant systems in the military s possession. Germany is not just the Bundeswehr, Helmbold noted, adding that it also refers to the capabilities of the industry. According to a defense blog run by journalist Thomas Wiegold, Diehl could divert a planned delivery of the ground-based middle-range IRIS-T SLM air defense system from Egypt and send it to Ukraine instead. The company s production capacity currently allows it manufacture two such systems per year, the journalist added. IRIS-T SLM systems have also previously been delivered to Sweden. The Bundeswehr had reportedly only considered procuring it but has not struck any such deals with Diehl so far. On Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told the parliament that the planned delivery of the air-defense system to Ukraine would take a while, months. She also added that the system produced by Diehl had initially been intended for another country. German tabloid Bild reported in mid-May that IRIS-T SLM systems could be deployed by Ukraine in November. Berlin has been steadily supplying Kiev with small arms, anti-tank missiles and ammunition since the start of Russia s military operation in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Scholz has faced criticism at home over his reluctance to supply Ukraine with the heavier weapons Kiev has repeatedly requested. On Wednesday, Scholz touted his record of providing military aid to Kiev and called the decision to break Germany s tradition of not sending arms to conflict zones courageous.

"31 May, 2022",World doesn't share West's negative views of Russia poll,"Western countries are more inclined to have a poor attitude towards Russia, according to a global survey Negative views of Russia are primarily confined to US-allied Western states, a new global survey conducted by a NATO-linked lobby group has found. At the same time, the so-called Alliance of Democracies Foundation discovered that Asian countries maintain strong support for Russia, while Latin American nations appear to be split on the matter. The pressure group is funded by the US-government, the EU and other sources, such as Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk. It's aligned with NATO's Atlantic Council adjunct and is run by the military bloc's former secretary journal, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Published by Berlin-based analytics' firm Latana, on Monday, the Democracy Perception Index surveyed 53 highly populated countries in Asia, Latin America, the US and Europe, asking respondents a number of questions ranging from their perception of their own country s democracy to their opinion of other nations. The report found there was a sharp polarization between Western countries and the rest of the world in their attitude towards Russia. In Europe, 55% of countries were in favor of cutting economic ties with Russia in light of its military offensive against Ukraine, while in Asia the majority of countries were against such moves. In Latin America, opinion was evenly split. A majority of the 31 countries sampled were in favor of cutting ties with Moscow, but 20 of these were in Europe. Among those with the most negative attitude towards Russia were Poland (87%), Portugal (79%), Sweden (77%), Italy (65%), Great Britain (65%), the USA (62%), and Germany (62%). By contrast, a total of 20 countries opposed cutting ties with Russia, including Greece, Kenya, Turkey, China, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, Algeria, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, Morocco, Malaysia, Peru, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. Opinions in Colombia were evenly split on the issue. The survey also noted the nations with the most positive attitude towards Russia, among which were India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Egypt. The poll showed that, while there were mixed opinions on Russia, the world had strong sympathy for Ukraine. Almost half of respondents worldwide (46%) reportedly stated that the EU, the US, and NATO were providing too little assistance to Kiev, while just 11% felt they were doing too much.

"27 May, 2022",Ex-Louvre director faces criminal charges,"Jean-Luc Martinez allegedly turned a blind eye to criminally obtained Egyptian artifacts The former director of the Louvre Museum in Paris, Jean-Luc Martinez, has been charged with money laundering and complicity in organized gang fraud, which apparently involved the trafficking of archaeological objects taken out of Egypt during the unrest in the early 2010s. Investigators believe that Martinez turned a blind eye to fake certificates of origin for five criminally obtained pieces which ended up in the Louvre s Abu Dhabi branch, AFP reported, citing sources. The suspected fraud allegedly involved several art experts. According to The Art Newspaper, Martinez, who headed the Louvre between 2013 and 2021, was detained earlier this week, along with the head of the museum s Egyptian department, Vincent Rondot, and renowned Egyptologist Olivier Perdu. Both Perdu and Rondot were later released without charges. Martinez, who is now an ambassador for international cooperation in the field of heritage, was placed under judicial supervision and charged on Wednesday in relation to the ongoing antiquities trafficking investigation. Martinez denies any wrongdoing, according to his lawyers. For now, he reserves his statements for the courts and has no doubt that his good faith will be established, his lawyers, Jacqueline Laffont and Fran√ßois Artuphel, told AFP. The case was opened in 2018, two years after the Louvre Abu Dhabi purchased five ancient Egyptian artifacts, including a rare pink granite stele of Tutankhamun, for several million euros. Since then, the investigation has seen three people detained and charged: Two experts in Mediterranean archeology, Christophe Kunicki and Richard Semper, as well as an owner of a gallery in Hamburg, Roben Dib, who brokered the sale of the artifacts. Dib was extradited to France for questioning. The Paris Louvre is yet to comment on the case, but Louvre Abu Dhabi said that it applies a strict international protocol for artworks entering the collection, as outlined in the intergovernmental agreement between Abu Dhabi and France, signed in 2007. This protocol is strictly aligned with the 1970 UNESCO Convention [against the illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts] and follows the most stringent standards of major museums in the world, the museum said in a statement, as quoted by the BBC. French investigators reportedly believe that, during the Arab Spring uprisings, artifacts from several countries, including Libya, Yemen, Syria, as well as Egypt, were illegally removed. Hundreds of artifacts were thought to have been sold to galleries and museums around the world, which apparently did not give much thought to questions of origins. The Arab Spring protests, riots, and armed rebellions which spread across many Arab countries in the early 2010s resulted in several long-standing rulers being toppled, including then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The unrest in several countries turned into full-scale civil wars and even international conflicts, some of which are ongoing, as is the case in Yemen.

"25 May, 2022",Russia warns against naval coalition to escort Ukrainian grain,"Such an international mission would only increase tensions in the Black Sea, Russia s deputy FM says Moscow has warned against putting together an international naval coalition to make sure ships with grain leave Ukrainian ports amid a claimed Russian blockade in the Black Sea. Ships with grain have been unable to depart from Ukraine amid the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. The Ukrainian authorities and the West have been blaming Russia for blocking their passage, while Moscow has insisted that the logistical problems have been created by naval mines placed by Ukraine. The arrival of a foreign naval coalition would seriously escalate the situation in the Black Sea, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said on Wednesday. The idea that willing countries should provide its warships and planes to ensure that the grain supplies can leave [the Ukrainian port city of] Odessa safely and reach the Bosphorus without Russian interference was proposed by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis during his visit to Great Britain on Tuesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reportedly voiced London s support, in principle, for such a coalition. Not only the UK, but countries affected by the grain shortage, such as Egypt, could take part in the non-NATO mission, according to Landsbergis. Rudenko also replied to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who claimed on Tuesday that Moscow was knowingly blocking the Black Sea and thus responsible for the starvation of millions of people. We are always ready for dialogue with everyone who strives for peace, for the peaceful resolution of all problems and that includes the Ukrainian grain issue, the Russian diplomat said. Rudenko reminded that Moscow repeatedly pointed out that the solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the removal of sanctions that were imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions. It also requires Ukraine to demine all ports where ships are docked. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian path [for ships with grain] and it s so doing every day, he added. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier warned that the fighting between Russia and Ukraine has put the world on the brink of a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system as the two countries are major producers of food, accounting for, among other things, 30% of global wheat exports. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.

"24 May, 2022",EU state calls for naval coalition to escort Ukrainian grain,"Lithuania says willing countries should join efforts to lift what it calls a Russian blockade in the Black Sea An international naval coalition should be put together to ensure ships carrying Ukrainian grain can leave Black Sea ports amid an alleged Russian blockade of the coastline, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis has suggested. Landsbergis proposed the idea during talks with UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in London on Monday, he explained to the Guardian in an interview. Truss reportedly voiced Britain s support, in principle, for such a coalition. Russia has denied that it s imposing a naval blockade on Ukraine, calling the reports speculation, and insisting that Kiev itself has caused logistical problems for shipping by planting mines in its own ports. But according to the Lithuanian foreign minister, a coalition of the willing countries with significant naval power is required to protect shipping routes in the Black Sea from Russia. This naval escort operation should not involve NATO, Landsbergis said. This would be a non-military humanitarian mission and is not comparable with a no-fly zone, hetoldthe Guardian. Not only Britain, but countries that have been hit by grain shortages, including Egypt, could join the operation, the diplomat suggested. Time is very very short. We are closing in on a new harvest and there is no other practical way of exporting the grain except through the Black Sea port of Odessa, he insisted. It is imperative that we show vulnerable countries we are prepared to take the steps that are needed to feed the world. Landsbergis said he believes that in this endeavor military ships or planes or both would be used to ensure that the grain supplies can leave Odessa safely and reach the Bosphorus without Russian interference. However, he acknowledged that carrying out such a plan would require demining some areas and getting approval from Turkey, which controls the entrance to the Black Sea and could view the escort operation as escalatory. According to the Guardian, after the meeting, Truss said Britain would be willing to provide its ships for the escort mission if the issues raised by Landsbergis are resolved. What we need to do is deal with this global food security issue and the UK is working on an urgent solution to get the grain out of Ukraine, she was quoted by the newspaper as saying. With Russia and Ukraine accounting for some 30% of global wheat exports, the conflict between the two neighbors has put the world on the brink of a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system, according to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov agreed with Guterres concerns on Monday, saying that is true, while insisting Russia was not the source of the problem which is causing the threat of world hunger. The sources of this problem are those who imposed sanctions, and the sanctions themselves. He said Ukrainian forces have planted naval mines in the Black Sea, making shipping in the area virtually impossible. According to Peskov, Kiev could also use rail routes to export its grain. Poland sends trains with weapons to Ukraine, and no one prevents them from exporting grain back on the same trains, he said. ",https://www.rt.com/news/555990-ukraine-uk-grain-lithuania/
"23 May, 2022",Dmitry Trenin: How Russia must reinvent itself to defeat the West's 'hybrid war',"Russia's very existence is under threat. The country has to take serious measures to ensure it survives ByDmitry Trenin, member of Russia's Foreign and Defense Policy Council The stand-off between Russia and the Western nations, which has been developing since 2014, escalated into an active confrontation with the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, back in late February. In other words, the Great Game has ceased to be a game. It has become total war, though a hybrid one so far, since the armed conflict in Ukraine is not of a full-scale nature at present. However, the danger of it intensifying towards a direct collision not only exists, but is increasing. The challenge Russia is facing has no equivalents in our history. It s not just that we have neither allies nor even potential partners left in the West. Frequent comparisons with the Cold War of the mid and late 20th century are inaccurate and rather disorienting. In terms of globalization and new technology, the modern form of confrontation is not only of a larger scale than the previous one, it is also much more intense. Ultimately, the main field of the ongoing battle is located inside the country. The asymmetry between the opponents is huge, particularly the imbalance between the forces and capabilities available to them. Based on this, the US and its allies have set much more radical goals than the relatively conservative containment and deterrence strategies used toward the Soviet Union. They are in fact striving to exclude Russia from world politics as an independent factor, and to completely destroy the Russian economy. The success of this strategy would allow the US-led West to finally resolve the""Russia question""and create favorable prospects for victory in the confrontation with China. Such an attitude on the part of the adversary does not imply room for any serious dialogue, since there is practically no prospect of a compromise, primarily between the United States and Russia, based on a balance of interests. The new dynamic of Russian-Western relations involves a dramatic severance of all ties, and increased Western pressure on Russia (the state, society, economy, science and technology, culture, and so on) on all fronts. This is no longer a source of discord between the opponents of the Cold War period, who then became (unequal) partners. It looks more like the drawing of a clearer dividing line between them, with the West refusing to accept even the perfunctory neutrality of individual countries. Moreover, the shared anti-Russian agenda has already become an important structural element of unity within the European Union, while strengthening American leadership in the Western world. In these circumstances, it s an illusory hope that Russia s opponents will listen to reason or be represented by more moderate political figures as a result of internal upheavals in their countries. There has been a fundamental shift towards disengagement and confrontation even in the political classes of countries where the attitude towards Moscow had until now been determined primarily by important economic interests (Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Finland). Thus, the systemic confrontation between the West and Russia is likely to be protracted. This circumstance almost completely nullifies Russia s previous foreign policy strategy towards the US and EU, which was aimed at the West recognizing Russian security interests, ensuring cooperation on issues of global strategic stability and European security, non-interference in each other s internal affairs, and building mutually beneficial economic and other ties with Washington and Brussels. However, recognizing that the previous agenda is now irrelevant does not mean we should abandon active politics and completely submit to the circumstances. It is Russia itself that should be at the center of Moscow's foreign policy strategy during this period of confrontation with the West and rapprochement with non-Western states. The country will have to be increasingly on its own. The outcome of the confrontation is not predetermined though. Circumstances affect Russia, but Russian politics can also change the world around it. The main thing to keep in mind is that no strategy can be developed without a clear set of goals. We need to start with ourselves, with an awareness of who we are, where we come from and what we strive for, based on our values and interests. Foreign policy has always been closely linked with domestic policy, in the loose meaning of the word, including economics, social relations, science, technology, culture, etc. Facing a new type of warfare which Russia is forced to wage, the line is erased between what was called the front line and the rear in previous eras. In such a fight, it's not just impossible to win, it is impossible to survive, if the elites remain fixated on further personal enrichment and society is left in a depressed and overly relaxed state. ""Re-establishing"" the Russian Federationon a politically more sustainable, economically efficient, socially just and morally sound basis becomes urgently necessary. We have to understand that the strategic defeat that the West, led by the United States, is preparing for Russia will not bring peace and a subsequent restoration of relations. It is highly probable that the theatre of the ""hybrid war"" will simply move from Ukraine further to the east, into the borders of Russia, and its existence in its current form will be contested. This enemy's strategy should be actively countered. In the field of foreign policy, the most pressing objective is clearly to strengthen the independence of Russia as a civilization, as a major independent global player, to provide an acceptable level of security and to create favorable conditions for all-round development. In order to achieve this objective in the current conditions which are more complex and difficult than even recently there is a need for an effective integrated strategy general political, military, economic, technological, informational and so on. The immediate and most important task of this strategy is to achieve strategic success in Ukraine within the parameters that have been set and explained to the public. It is necessary to clarify the stated objectives of the operation and use all opportunities to achieve them. The continuation of what many now call a ""phoney war"" leads to a prolongation of military activities, increased losses and a decrease in the global stature of Russia. The solution to most of the country s other strategic objectives now depends directly on whether and when it succeeds in achieving strategic success in Ukraine. The most important of these broader foreign policy tasks is not the overthrow of the US-centric world order by any means and at any price (its erosion is due to independent factors, but a Russian success in Ukraine would be a painful blow to US global hegemony) and of course, not a return to the fold of this set-up on more favorable terms, but the consistent building of a new system of international relations together with non-Western countries, and the formation, in cooperation with them, of a new world order and its consequent promotion. We need to work on this task now, but it will only be possible to act fully after a strategic success in Ukraine. The framing of new geopolitical, geo-economic and military-strategic realities in the western part of the former Soviet Union, in the Donbass and Novorossiya, becomes extremely important and relevant in this context. A long-term priority here is the further development of allied relations and integration ties with Belarus. This category also includes strengthening Russia s security in Central Asia and the South Caucasus. In the context of rebuilding foreign economic relations and creating a new model of the global order, the most important directions are cooperation with world powers China and India as well as Brazil and with leading regional players Turkey, ASEAN countries, the Gulf states, Iran, Egypt, Algeria, Israel, South Africa, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico and others. It is in these areas, rather than in traditional Euro-Atlantic arenas, that the main resources of diplomacy, foreign economic relations, and the information and cultural spheres should be deployed. Whereas in the military sphere the main focus for Russia now is the West, in other areas it is the rest of the world the larger and more dynamic part. Alongside the development of bilateral relations, a new priority should be given to the multilateral interaction between states in the non-Western part of the world. There should be a greater focus on building international institutions. The Eurasian Economic Union, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Russia-India-China grouping, BRICS, and the mechanisms for dialogue and partnership between the Russian Federation and ASEAN, Africa and Latin America need a boost for further development. Russia is capable of playing a leading role in developing a framework ideology for these organizations, harmonizing the interests of partner countries and coordinating on common agendas. In relations with the West, the strategy of Russia will continue to address the containment of the nuclear, conventional and cyber abilities of the US, and deterring it from exerting military pressure on Russia and its allies, or even attacking them. Never since the end of the Soviet-American confrontation has the prevention of nuclear war been more relevant than now. The new challenge after achieving strategic success in Ukraine will be to force NATO countries to actually recognize Russian interests and to secure the new borders of Russia. Moscow needs to assess carefully the reasonableness, possibilities and limits of situational cooperation with various political and social groups in the West, as well as with other temporary potential allies outside the bloc whose interests coincide in some respects with those of Russia. The task is not to inflict damage on the enemy anywhere, but to use various irritants to divert the opponent s attention and resources from the Russian focus, as well as to influence the domestic political situation in the US and EU in a direction favorable to Moscow. The most important objective in this regard is developing a strategy for an emerging confrontation between the United States and China. The partnership nature of Russian-Chinese relations is the main thing that positively distinguishes the current hybrid war against the West from the previous cold one. Although Beijing is not a formal military ally of Moscow, the strategic partnership between the two countries has been officially characterized as more than a formal alliance. Russia's largest economic partner has not joined the anti-Russian sanctions, but Chinese companies and banks are deeply integrated into the global economy and are wary of US and EU sanctions, thus limiting the possibility of interaction. There is mutual understanding between the leaders of Russia and China, and the people of the two countries are friendly towards each other. Finally, the United States views both countries as its adversaries ‚Äî China as its main competitor and Russia as the main current threat. US policy brings Russia and China even closer. Under a hybrid war, political and diplomatic support from China, and even limited economic and technological cooperation with it, are very important for Russia. Moscow does not currently have the opportunity to force even closer rapprochement with Beijing, but there is no necessity in too close an alliance. If US-Chinese contradictions aggravate, Russia should be ready to support Beijing politically, as well as provide on a limited scale and under certain conditions, military-technical assistance to it, while avoiding direct participation in the conflict with Washington. Opening a second front in Asia is unlikely to significantly ease the pressure of the West on Russia, but it will dramatically increase tension in relations between Russia and India. The transition from a confrontational, but still conditionally peaceful, state of economic relations between Russia and the West to a situation of economic war requires Russia s deep revision of its foreign economic policy. This policy can no longer be implemented primarily on the basis of economic or technological expediency. Measures aimed at de-dollarizing and repatriating offshore finances are under implementation. Business elites (often incorrectly described as ""oligarchs"") who previously took profits outside the country are forcibly ""nationalized"". Import substitution is underway. The Russian economy is shifting focus from the policy of raw materials export to the development of closed-cycle production processes. So far, however, the country has mostly been defensive and reactive. Now it is necessary to move from retaliatory steps to initiatives that will strengthen Russia s position in the total economic war declared by the West, allowing it inflict significant damage on the enemy. In this regard, a closer alignment of efforts of the state and the business community s activities is required, as well as implementation of a coordinated policy in such sectors as finance, energy, metallurgy, agriculture, modern technology (especially related to information and communications), transport, logistics, military exports and economic integration ‚Äî both within the framework of the Eurasion Economic Union and the Union State of Russia and Belarus and taking into account the new realities in the Donbass and the northern Black Sea region. A separate task is to revise the Russian approach and policy position on climate change issues under the changed conditions. It is also important to determine the permissible limits of Russia's financial, economic and technological dependence on neutral countries (primarily China), and launch a technological partnership with India. War is always the most severe and cruel test of durability, endurance and inner strength. Today, and for the foreseeable future, Russia is a country at war. It will be able to continue its trajectory only if the authorities and society unite on the basis of solidarity and mutual obligations, mobilize all available resources and at the same time expand opportunities for enterprising citizens, remove obvious obstacles that weaken the country from within, and develop a realistic strategy to deal with external adversaries. Up to now, we have merely celebrated the Victory won by previous generations in 1945. The current challenge is whether we are able to save and develop the country. To do this, Russia's strategy must overcome the circumstances surrounding and constraining it.

Manchester City midfielder De Bruyne has netted 15 times in the English top flight this term and provided seven assists for his teammates.

"18 May, 2022","The imminent global food crisis is being blamed on Russia, but the truth is rather more complex","Just-in-time supply chains, globalism and governments lack of foresight may lead to global hunger ByDr. Mathew Maavak, a Malaysian expert on risk foresight and governance. ByDr. Mathew Maavak, a Malaysian expert on risk foresight and governance. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is undoubtedly impacting global grain supplies, as well as the means of growing crops around the world. But is the looming global food crisis solely Russia s fault as spun by the Western media machine? Only a few months ago, Covid-19, government-imposed lockdowns and climate change were repeatedly blamed for this scenario. A recent White HouseJoint Statementby US President Joe Biden and EU leader Ursula von der Leyen clearly singled out the supposed new culprit: We are deeply concerned by how Putin s war in Ukraine has caused major disruptions to international food and agriculture supply chains, and the threat it poses to global food security. We recognize that many countries around the world have relied on imported food staples and fertilizer inputs from Ukraine and Russia, with Putin s aggression disrupting that trade. The concept of global food security these days appear as fleeting as Biden s mnemonic prowess. It has been 12 years since the world was shaken by the Arab Spring, a series of events in which hunger played a significant role, and which, in turn, led to violent uprisings and yet-unresolved civil wars in Libya, Yemen and Syria. Big Tech, Western officials and influencers fuelled this mayhem in the name of freedom and democracy but never proffered any concrete solutions. Instead,global hungergrew unabated, while its root causes were explicated through the lens of climate change and global governance . In the meantime, right at the doorsteps of the Tech giants, the streets of San Francisco were increasingly populated by the homeless and strewn withhuman faecesand discarded needles from drug abuse. Even a new urban art genre emerged in the form ofpoop graffiti! Nothing better represents the disconnect between the lofty promisesand septic realities of Silicon Valley. Here is something else for the reader to ponder: Contact-tracing technologies that were used to lock down societies were never trialled to connect the poor to nearby farmers markets, food banks and soup kitchens. A rational person cannot be blamed for suspecting that the intention all along was to eviscerate small-scale farmers, grocers and traders during lockdowns and thereby render citizens prostrate before governments and Big Business. As for technocrats who lap up the smarmy fantasies of the World Economic Forum (WEF), what lessons have they learnt since the fateful Arab Spring? Here we look at two inexcusable failings of the purveyors of global governance. These are linked to the very issues which Biden and von der Leyen are using to scapegoat Russia. The Arab Spring and its bloody aftermath should have taught governments a lesson about the imperative of establishing new national granaries. Well-maintained facilities can store wheat and corn, amongst other goods, formore than 10 years. Individuals can extend this shelf-life to a whopping31 yearsunder proper conditions. Grain stats worldwide also raise questions over government commitments to food security. Global wheat production, for instance, hassteadily increasedduring the last decade. According to a Statista.com brief on Jan 27: The global production volume of wheat came to about over 772 million metric tons in the marketing year of 2020/21. This was an increase of about ten million tons compared to the previous year. Wheat stocks is [sic] also estimated to increase to about 294 million metric tons worldwide by 2021. Although these figures are constantly updated as newer data pours in, there was indeed record wheat output in the face of relentless global lockdowns. However, most governments did little to build or expand their food stockpiles. Granaries were an indispensable feature of ancient civilizations. The Bible recounts how Joseph guided Egypt throughseven years of famineby establishing imperial granaries during the seven years of abundance. Thousands of years later, however, our modern-day sages are mesmerized by theWEF mantraof you ll own nothing and you ll be happy by 2030. Does that include ownership of real food? I ask this because the WEF is currently promotingsynthetic meatandinsect gourmetamong other wonders. If your government failed to set up a strategic food stockpile in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, do not blame Russia (or Ukraine) when the proverbial hits the fan. Unfortunately, ourGosplan-styled world is overly-centralized, bringing with it attendant risks to the global supply chain. An acute fertilizer shortage is now one of them. Sanctions, and the freezing of$300 billionin Russian assets worldwide, were accompanied by bottlenecks in exports of grain and fertilizers. The escalating energy war between Russia and Europe is also pushing the price of natural gas and essential downstream products through the roof. Fertilizers are primarily made from nitrogen, phosphorus and/or potassium. Nitrogen and ammonia (another fertilizer compound consisting of nitrogen and hydrogen) are extracted from natural gas. Our food security is therefore inextricably linked to fossil fuel production. This is an immutable reality which eco-warriors love to forget. As the military operation in Ukraine drags on, few dare speculate the end game. However,Bloombergwarns that for the first time ever, farmers the world over‚Äîall at the same time ‚Äî are testing the limits of how little chemical fertilizer they can apply without devastating their yields come harvest time. More ominously,fertilizer-producing factoriesworldwide number in the paltry hundreds. In other words, global agricultural output is expected to plummet in both qualitative and quantitative terms over the coming months. AstrophysicistDavid Friedbergpaints a more alarming picture. The ongoing West-Russia standoff may likely result in the starvation of hundreds of millions of additional people‚Äîover and above the 800 million who already facedaily hunger. Our centralized just-in-time (JIT) global production system only allows for a 90-day food supply for the planet. The ongoingbaby-formula shortagein the US is directly linked to the pitfalls of centralized JIT production. Could this catastrophe have been avoided? The West and Russia had been on a collision course since 2014 right after Moscow s reincorporation of Crimea. The world has had eight long years to game out any escalation of the new West-Russia cold war. As Russia steadily built its gold reserves, the West could have likewise studied, identified and stored up items it needed from Russia in the event of a geopolitical escalation. Right at the top of that list should have been fertilizers and storable food. Instead, the West was more interested in Pussy Riot and the promotion of the liberal agenda. Ultimately, there are absolutely no excuses for the criminal lack of foresight among governments. For those who wonder about the longevity of stored fertilizer, here are somefactsfrom a gardening website: Liquid chemical fertilizers can be stored for a decade while liquid organic fertilizers have a shelf-life of 5-8 years. Dry granular or crystalized fertilizer can be stored indefinitely. Where are the fertilizer storage facilities that could have buffered our farms for years? Over the coming months, the EU may be tempted to substitute chemical fertilizers from Russia with human waste sludge. However, as a recentMongabayarticle cautions, human waste ‚Äî including pharmaceuticals and microplastics contained in faeces and urine ‚Äî is a major public health hazard, causing disease outbreaks, and putting biodiversity at risk. They contain a variety of contaminants and hazardous pathogens that may affect the entire food chain. Contaminants such as nanoplastics cannot be filtered out using conventional means. Despite the evident risks, the UK reportedly imported 27,500 tonnes ofDutch sewage sludgefor its agricultural needs in 2020. WestEuropean farms, by extension, have now become the biggest global reservoir of microplastics due to their use of sewage sludge. The degradation of the EU's farmland may be exacerbated as the Russia-Ukraine conflict drags on. Whether famine will ravage the world by Christmas is anyone s guess. But make no mistake: it will be poorer societies ‚Äî primarily in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia ‚Äî that will suffer first and foremost. Even if Russia and Ukraine sign a truce tomorrow and normality returns to the region, many parts of China are facing unprecedented lockdowns. The nuts and bolts of the global economy are now bobbing aimlessly inside countless vessels along the coastlines of China. These include items essential to agriculture. Interestingly, the WHO has slammed China s zero-Covid policy as being unsustainable, which is a marked departure from earlier praise heaped onNew Zealandfor doing the same thing. In this cauldron of madness, ourcollective futurewas recently summed up this way: The whole planet is a pot, and we're all frogs.",https://www.rt.com/russia/555615-global-hunger-food-crisis/
"18 May, 2022",Can Africa replace Russia as the EU's main source of gas?,"If such a move were easy, it would have been attempted a long time ago. In 2021, Russia supplied about 45% of the European Union's natural gas, pumping around 155 billion cubic meters (bcm) of it through several pipelines. The EU is now apparently considering plans to phase out Russian gas, and reports have appeared in recent weeks that a number of African countries such as Nigeria, Senegal and Angola are being considered as the replacement source. There is even more hype around African gas than American or Qatari LNG, which seem to be more obvious substitutes. Simply because deals with those states don t require much negotiating, while African gas remains a different matter entirely. Italian government delegations have visited Algeria, Angola, Egypt and the Republic of the Congo since February. So far, most of the visits and negotiations have ended with only declarations and letters of intent, and leading energy think tanks are expressing a certain skepticism about the prospects for gas supplies from Africa to the EU. The EU imports gas via pipelines from Algeria and Libya, as well as getting liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, and Nigeria. The total capacity of Africa s gas export infrastructure (both pipelines and LNG plants) is about 170 billion cubic meters (bcm) per annum. At the same time, 125 bcm of this capacity is under the control of Algeria, where annual gas exports are gradually decreasing to a level between 40 and 50 bcm. In total, export capacity utilization in Africa is about 60% for LNG plants and 40% for pipelines. While in Algeria the right to export gas is reserved for state-owned Sonatrach, in the other African countries the export infrastructure is controlled by Western oil majors, mainly representing the buyers side, namely Eni, Shell, TotalEnergies and others. Consequently, the ability of African governments to influence the volumes and directions of exports is open to question. In 2021, African nations supplied 16.6 million tons (MT) of LNG (approximately equivalent to 23 bcm) to the countries of the EU, another 7 MT was delivered to the UK and Turkey, 16.7 MT to Asia, and 0.5 MT to Latin America. Despite post-pandemic economic growth and the dynamic recovery of gas demand, Africa was only able to increase LNG exports by 2 MT compared to the crisis year of 2020. Pipeline exports to Spain and Italy from Algeria and Libya totaled 35 bcm. Thus, Africa exported around 68 bcm to the EU in 2021. Yes, it can. However, it would be in small volumes and involve the transfer of spot LNG cargoes from Asia to the EU. In total, such a maneuver could provide about 10 bcm per annum. Still, the EU will have to offer better prices than buyers in Asia, the UK (also planning to abandon Russian gas), and Turkey one of the largest importers in the Mediterranean region. African gas exporters can be divided into two categories: those with spare export capacities (Algeria, Egypt) but lacking enough supplies of their own gas; and those with gas but without the capacity to properly export it (Nigeria, Mauritania/Senegal, and Mozambique). Algeria and Egypt are taking steps to increase production, but most of this growth is spent meeting the needs of their domestic markets (electricity generation, industries, fertilizer production); liquefaction facilities are being built in Mauritania, Senegal, Mozambique and Nigeria, and it is from these countries that we can expect an increase of exports in the medium term. Investment decisions have already been taken to build new export facilities in Nigeria, Mozambique, and on the border of Senegal and Mauritania. In total, they will add up to 14 MTPA of LNG (approximately 19.3 bcm) by 2025. The seventh train of the Nigeria LNG plant is expected to produce up to 8 MTPA, the Great Tortue project on the border of Mauritania and Senegal will supply 2.5 MTPA, and Coral South in Mozambique will yield 3.4 MTPA. Investment decisions on these projects were made in 2017-2019, long before the current stage of the crisis in Ukraine. But this energy is not for the EU only. Nigeria traditionally sells 50% of its LNG to the Asia-Pacific region, while the project in Mozambique is also targeting markets in India, China and Japan. Finally, demand for LNG is gradually emerging in Africa itself (South Africa, etc.), so some of the gas may even remain inside the continent. If Russian supplies could have been abandoned in favor of African equivalents, the EU would have done it long ago. This task has been prioritized since 2008, when then-EU Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs visited Nigeria to discuss the Trans-Saharan route, and Brussels has been striving to increase supplies, from this source with all its might but without much success. It is almost impossible to squeeze more gas out of Africa. Thus the main beneficiary of the EU s refusal of the Russian product will be the United States, alongside Qatar (where the main producer is ExxonMobil). Israel, Azerbaijan and Iran have a good chance of getting a share of the pie as well. At the same time, Africa has been and remains an important source of energy for the EU. Given the ongoing crisis, the pressure on its countries to export more gas at the expense of their domestic markets will intensify, and Western majors leaving Russia will certainly turn to Africa in search of a resource base. The current market situation may revive projects previously considered unviable, including the construction of pipelines across the Sahara from Nigeria to Algeria, the Eastern Mediterranean pipeline, or as many as three new projects for the export of LNG from the East African coast of Mozambique, Tanzania, or Djibouti. On the other hand, in the next decade, gas will play a key role in the development of the energy sector and industries (production of fertilizers, cement, polypropylene, etc.) in many African countries. The main producing states, primarily Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria, will have to choose between meeting growing domestic demand and the temptation to increase exports. The choice of priorities between exports and domestic consumption (more foreign currency earnings or a larger available supply for the energy sector and industries) will determine Africa s role in world energy markets over the next 20 years. The distribution of gas between domestic consumption and export would depend, among other factors, on government decisions, often made under pressure from operators, buyers and donor countries. Regulators and state-owned companies in countries like Mozambique and Nigeria often make their decisions on the recommendations of foreign consultants, and such choices do not always correspond to the interests of the host countries. Algeria and Egypt have moved much further in the development of their domestic markets and give them priority, but the same foreign consultants, acting in close alliance with European and multinational corporations, are putting enormous pressure on them to abandon subsidies, liberalize their markets, and divide state monopolies. But the EU still has an opportunity. A devastating economic crisis, with a sharp decline in electricity demand and production in Algeria or Egypt would free up additional volumes of gas for export (as once happened with Soviet gas). But such crises would be tragedies, and fortunately are still only a hypothetical risk. Russia could have played a role in supporting and developing African gas markets. While the office of Gazprom was operating in Nigeria, the country refrained from approving (ruinous) decisions on export projects, counting on cooperation with Russians and others to develop the domestic market. However, no investment decisions were taken, and Nigeria went back to its old ways: building new liquefaction facilities. Gazprom, Rosneft, LUKOIL sporadically participate in E&P projects across Africa, actually playing along with their own strategic adversaries. If they turn from these projects to develop African domestic markets, both Russia and Africa will benefit, but there is not much evidence of that yet.

Since at least the 2000s, it has been the top seller of weapons to New Delhi, with the exception of last year, when France took the lead. The US, Israel, and the UK are also among the major suppliers. India has a policy of decreasing its dependence on foreign supplies by developing the domestic defense sector and has also diversified arms imports in the past years, but Moscow remains its key partner, meeting almost half of the needs in the last five years. According to Bloomberg, Washington hopes the assistance will help draw India away from Russia and closer to the US. The report comes ahead of next week s summit of leaders of the Quad a four-party Indo-Pacific security mechanism which also includes the US, Japan, and Australia. Washington perceives it as a key component for opposing China, another Asian powerhouse, with which India has a long-standing rivalry. Like many other non-Western nations, India has refused to join the US-led campaign to punish Russia for its military operation against Ukraine. Rather than sacrificing its economic interests by heaping sanctions on Moscow, like the majority of European countries, New Delhi has been buying more Russian crude at a significantly discounted price. While Western officials have voiced displeasure with the lack of support for their Russia policies, they stopped short of targeting India with any retaliation. The same was true before the conflict in Ukraine. Washington failed to impose sanctions against India for purchasing advanced Russian S-400 air defense systems. This contrasted with its treatment of China and even NATO ally Turkey, which were both hit with sanctions for buying the same weapons. Bloomberg sources would not say when and if the aid deal would be announced and what arms India would receive from the US. The report implied that French weapons may be part of it in addition to American products. If the package amounts to the sum suggested by the sources, India would become one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, behind Ukraine, Israel, and Egypt. When asked by the news outlet, however, neither American nor Indian officials would comment on the discussions. ",https://www.rt.com/news/555681-us-india-military-aid/

Gueye was a surprise omission from the PSG team for their Ligue 1 meeting with Montpellier on Saturday, which the French champions won 4-0 thanks to a double from Lionel Messi and strikes from Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe. Messi and Co. donned special shirts for the match which displayed their numbers in rainbow colors a show of solidarity for International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, which is marked on Tuesday.

"15 May, 2022",Egypt assesses impact of Ukraine-related crisis,"The North-African nation says Russia-Ukraine conflict has cost the national economy $7 billion Egypt s economy has sustained losses of up to 130 billion Egyptian pounds ($7 billion) amid the Ukrainian crisis, according to the country s Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly, as quoted by TASS. The aftermath of the war has placed a huge financial burden on us and we have invested 130 billion pounds to cover rising prices for strategic goods, Madbouly said on Sunday, pointing out that the indirect consequences of the events in Ukraine are estimated at another over $18 billion. According to the PM, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine has sent prices for vital produce soaring, having posed enormous challenges to the Egyptian economy. In May 2021, the price of a barrel of oil was $67, now it has reached $112, while a ton of wheat cost $270 a year ago, now we pay for the same volumes based on a price of $435 per ton, Madbouly explained. Previously, we had imported 42% of grain, while 31% of tourists were from Russia and Ukraine, and now we have to look for alternative markets. The PM also said that Egypt had managed to restore tourism after the Covid-19 pandemic and achieve budget profitability of $5.8 billion ahead of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. He added that despite Covid-related crisis and turmoil in the movement of world trade, the nation saw an unprecedented increase in income from the Suez Canal. Egypt s unemployment rate dropped to 7.2% in January-March, down from 7.4% in the previous quarter, the state statistics agency CAPMAS said on Sunday. The agency also reported that Egypt s annual inflation rate surged to 14.9% in April, significantly higher than the previous month s 12.1%. In March, Egypt s Central Bank raised its key interest rate for the first time since 2017, citing inflationary pressures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which hiked oil prices to record highs.

"15 May, 2022",UK 'black propaganda' campaign exposed by researcher,"London for decades sought to drive a wedge between Moscow, Beijing, the Arab world and Africa through fake news, a researcher claims A secretive unit within the British Foreign Office waged a""black propaganda""campaign against the USSR and China from the 1950s to the 1970s to undermine their global influence, the Guardian has reported, citing a researcher who studied a trove of recently declassified intelligence documents. London did not shy away from stirring up anti-Semitism, racism and Islamist sentiment to achieve its goals, the academic claims. These releases are among the most important of the past two decades. It's very clear now that the UK engaged in more black propaganda than historians assume and these efforts were more systemic, ambitious and offensive, Rory Cormac, a professor of international relations at Nottingham University, told the Guardian. According to the newspaper, the documents reveal hundreds of extensive and costly operations conducted by the Information Research Department (IRD) a covert unit initially established by the post-WWII Labour government to counter Communist propaganda. The unit went far beyond merely exposing Soviet disinformation, Cormac has said, adding that the UK""definitely intended to deceive audiences in order to get the message across."" The IRD had a separate highly secretive Special Editorial Unit responsible for so-called black propaganda, a special type of fake news designed to look as if it s produced by a nation or organization that the actual creator wants to discredit. Some of the reports sent to Western governments and media included analysis supposedly coming from independent institutions, which were secretly run by the IRD, and warned Western nations about alleged Soviet subversion. The British unit also forged at least 11 reports supposedly released by Soviet state-run news agencies, according to the Guardian. London particularly sought to drive a wedge between Moscow and its allies in the Arab world by both producing fake news discrediting the Soviet Union in the eyes of Arabs, and stirring up Islamist sentiment among them, the paper said. One such report, presented as coming from the USSR, blasted Soviet military aid to Egypt during the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel as a waste. The British operatives also forged pro-Islamist literature, including that of the Muslim Brotherhood a group that had significant influence in the Arab world at that time. Statements forged by the IRD saw the Muslim Brotherhood calling the Soviets filthy-tongued atheists and accused them of perceiving Egyptians as peasants following reactionary Islamic superstitions. The IRD also went as far as to create an entirely fictional Islamist group the League of Believers that attacked the Soviet Union for its atheism and blamed the Arab defeats in the wars against Israel on a lack of faith. The British unit reportedly did not shy away from stirring up anti-Semitic sentiment as well. One of its leaflets incited Egyptians to attack Israel by asking them: why don't they direct their armies against the Jews? The IRD was similarly active in Africa, where it repeatedly sought to convey an image of the Soviet Union seeing Africans as uncivilized. In 1963, the IRD forged a statement by the World Federation of Democratic Youth an organization linked to the USSR which called Africans primitive. Other forgeries included statements in which the Soviets decried the backwardness and political immaturity of Africa, while criticizing the skills of black African students enrolled in Soviet universities. Documents declassified back in 2021 and seen by the Guardian also showed that the British propaganda campaign had had a role in the mass slaughter of Communists in Indonesia in the 1960s. Between 500,000 and three million supporters of the Communist Party were killed at that time, according to various estimates. These efforts had the full support of several consecutive British governments, according to Cormac. In 1964, the Conservative Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home, ordered the IRD to target Ghana over its supposed leanings to Moscow. Months later, the Labour Foreign Secretary, Patrick Gordon Walker, called on the unit to produce black propaganda from time to time and particularly stir up racial tensions between the Africans and Chinese. Although the unit was officially disbanded in 1977, similar efforts allegedly continued for almost another decade, the Guardian says. Now, the British government is still engaged in an information war, according to Cormac. In February, just days before the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss revealed that the UK was creating a new unit to combat disinformation from Moscow. In March, the Telegraph reported that the unit dubbed the Government Information Cell was reaching Russian social media to disseminate London s view on the conflict in Ukraine. Liz Truss has a government information cell, and defense intelligence sends out daily tweets to pre-but Russian plots and gain the upper hand in the information war, but for much of the cold war the UK used far more devious means,""the researcher said, adding that the declassified papers are particularly significant as a precursor to more modern efforts of putting intelligence into the public domain.

"3 May, 2022",Emerging gas suppliers expected to replace Russia media,"Europe to buy gas in Africa, Bloomberg reports The European Union will turn to Africa to replace imports of natural gas from Russia, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Countries in Africa, such as Nigeria, Senegal, and Angola, offer largely untapped potential for liquified natural gas, the media outlet cites a draft EU document it reviewed. The European Commission is set to announce its plans for energy cooperation with the western African nations and other suppliers later this month as part of efforts to cut its energy reliance on Moscow amid the ongoing military offensive in Ukraine, Bloomberg adds. The EU pledged to slash Russian gas imports by two-thirds by next year and to eliminate its dependence before 2030. To achieve that, Europe has to reset its relationships with traditional suppliers and reach out to new emerging ones, the EU document adds, as the bloc needs to boost its LNG imports by 50 billion cubic meters a year until 2030 and increase shipments of pipeline gas from countries other than Russia. To meet its goal, the EU must fully implement its agreement with the US for the delivery of liquified natural gas (LNG), and also extend trade with suppliers such as Egypt, Israel, Azerbaijan and Australia. The EU s push to wean itself off Russian gas flow in line with Ukraine-related sanctions led to increased purchases by Europe amid already growing global demand and high LNG prices. Russia has been a major supplier of energy to the EU, meeting roughly 40% of the bloc s demand for natural gas. ",https://www.rt.com/business/554894-emerging-suppliers-replace-russia/
"2 May, 2022",Major global breadbasket fears crop slump,"India s record heat wave threatens wheat exports amid existing shortage concerns The world s second-largest wheat producer, India, is facing a drop in wheat output this year due to the unusually hot weather in March, Reuters reported on Monday. The country saw five consecutive years of record wheat harvests, and officials were expecting another record yield this year, hoping to step up exports amid supply disruptions due to the Ukraine crisis, Reuters said. In the fiscal year to March, India exported a record 7.85 million tonnes of wheat up 275% from the previous year and was planning to export 12 million tonnes this fiscal year. However, an official note from the government seen by Reuters estimates that the harvest will be at least 6% less than expected, threatening the export plans. India recorded its warmest March in 122 years this year, with the maximum temperature across the country rising nearly two degrees above normal to 33.1C (91.58F), according to data from the country s Meteorological Department. Grain prices have hit record highs in recent months due to supply shortage concerns as a result of Russia s military action in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine account for around 30% of global wheat exports, and are among the biggest wheat suppliers for Europe. Analysts have been voicing concerns that the current situation may lead to a full-blown global food crisis. In April, Russia hiked the wheat export tax to a historic high, but continued to export grain to some of its biggest customers, including Egypt, Turkey, and Iran.

"18 Apr, 2022",EU turns to Africa for help,"The bloc aims to strengthen energy cooperation to reduce dependence on Russia Europe is looking to Africa for its energy needs as countries seek to cut reliance on Russian imports amid the conflict in Ukraine, according to media reports. The EU s third-largest economy, Italy, secured a deal last week with Algeria for more natural gas imports. The North African country already supplies gas to Europe via three pipelines, one of which goes to Italy. The two other pipelines are linked to Spain. Italian energy supermajor Eni also signed an agreement on Wednesday with Egypt s state-owned Natural Gas Holding Company to promote gas exports to Europe. The deals come following a meeting between European ambassadors and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) last Monday, to strengthen partnership in the energy sector. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is expected to travel to central and southern Africa this week with potential deals in the Republic of Congo and Angola, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. All of these deals together could help to replace over half the supply Italy gets from Russia as early as 2023, according to Bloomberg. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU s gas and provides around a third of the bloc s oil needs. Earlier in April, the European Union approved a ban on Russian coal, but could not reach an agreement on an oil and natural gas embargo. Draghi told the Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that Europe can wean itself off Russian energy imports through diversification in a time frame that was shorter than what we imagined just a month ago. The PM added: We no longer want to depend on Russian gas, because economic dependence must not become political subjugation. To do this, we need to diversify energy sources and find new suppliers.

"16 Apr, 2022",Russia keeps grain flowing abroad,"Shipments to some of its major customers continue, data shows Russia has continued exporting grain to some of its biggest customers, including Egypt, Turkey, and Iran, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing the general director of the Moscow-based Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, Dmitry Rylko. Supplies have been maintained despite the surge in shipping costs, he said. According to Logistics OS, nearly 900,000 tons of wheat have been loaded at Russian ports so far this month, in line with the pace in March. Crop data from AgFlow also showed that Russian exports of key agricultural commodities, including wheat, fell by just 1 million tons over the first 13 days of April, meaning shipments abroad were close to the level for the same period in March. Last week, the US Department of Agriculture also raised its estimates for Russian wheat exports in the current season to 33 million tons, which is just 2 million tons less than it forecast before the crisis in Ukraine. Under Russian quotas, exports from February to June are limited to 8 million tons. Shipments are forecast to slow in April and in the coming months, according to Rylko, which he attributes to the stronger ruble and high export taxes. Export taxes are currently at a record high of $101.40 per ton, which means an intake for Moscow of about $3 million for every 30,000-ton shipment of wheat. Shipping costs from the Black Sea region have been also on the rise, having climbed by 50% to 80% from last year due to war risks, says UkrAgroConsult.Egypt booked one cargo from Russia at the latest wheat tender on Wednesday, while France took the bulk of purchases, Bloomberg said.

"10 Apr, 2022",Sailors rescued from ships stranded in Mariupol port,"Russian and DPR troops have rescued some 47 sailors from civilian ships blocked in the Port of Mariupol Russian and Donetsk forces have rescued some 47 civilian sailors stranded on board their ships in the port of Mariupol, the Donetsk People s Republic (DPR) militia said on Sunday. Military personnel of Russia s Armed Forces and the DPR have de-blockaded 47 crew members from Russia, Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ukraine, who were holed up on board of the ships, the DPR said in a statement. The civilian vessels were stranded in the Mariupol port amid the ongoing conflict, as the waterway had been heavily mined by Ukrainian nationalists, who used the ships and crews as shields, the DPR noted. The crews have already been brought into a safe zone, the militia added, without without naming the evacuated ships. Earlier in the day, the DPR claimed that two foreign vessels stranded in the Mariupol port had been boarded by a group of retreating Ukrainian nationalists from the notorious Azov regiment. The captured vessels are the Lady Augusta, a Jamaican-flagged cargo ship, and the Tsarevna, a Maltese-flagged bulk carrier. The Ukrainian forces have been firing mortars, grenade launchers, and small arms from the vessels while holding the crews hostage, the DPR said. The fate of the crews of the two captured vessels remains unclear. The city of Mariupol has seen intense fighting between Ukrainian and DPR forces, which are backed by the Russian military, over the past few weeks. Mariupol, which is claimed by the breakaway Donetsk republic as an integral part of its territory, has been largely captured by DPR-allied forces, yet Ukrainian fighters remain in several strongholds throughout the city. Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following Kiev s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state. Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.

"5 Apr, 2022",How India balanced all sides in the Russia-West conflict,"Refusing to condemn Russia s military operation in Ukraine, India has been managing a multi-aligned foreign policy, to its benefit ByAlexei Arora, a commentator writing on geopolitics, global political economy and political theory. Follow him onsubstack After Russia began its special military operation in Ukraine on February 24, the West was quick to condemn it and to impose further sanctions. The United Nations, EU meetings, and even NATO summits became the stage for Western countries and their satrapies to repeat their pledge of allegiance to the United States. But naturally there were some countries that, although they didn t outright side with Russia, didn t condemn its military operation either. While Western commentariats, think-tankers and bureaucrats expected this from China, they were somehow shocked to see a similar reaction come from India. Motions against Russia at the UN Security Council and the General Assembly saw abstentions by India. This was viewed with shock, anger, and disgust by the usual suspects in the West, who for some reason consider India to be an American colony due to their mutual distrust of China. However, it seems that these Western intellectuals have forgotten their history. India was the founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), along with Nasser s Egypt, Nkrumah s Ghana, Sukarno s Indonesia and Tito s SFR Yugoslavia. Founded in 1961 after the Bandung Conference, the aim of this organization was to resist being drawn into open alliances with both the US and USSR. But, with America s and Britain s affinity for Pakistan during the Cold War going as far as to admit Pakistan into a would-be Asian NATO called CENTO India was faced with little choice but to tilt towards the USSR, an alliance which further strengthened after the Sino-Soviet split saw China becoming cozy with Pakistan and the US. This relationship saw supplies of weapons, joint satellite and space programs, technology transfers, and a strong trade relationship. Perhaps the peak of this relationship was during the 1971 war of Bangladeshi liberation, which saw the Soviet Navy come to India s aide when the Americans and the Brits sent their warships to the Bay of Bengal to intimidate India and support Pakistan, ultimately driving the West away from the area and helping India drive Pakistan away from Bangladesh. During this time, the USSR also supported India in the UN for Kashmir-related issues. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, India was left without a reliable major partner in the international arena. Russia was undergoing its own cataclysmic tragedies under Yeltsin, and it appeared that the Americans were going to be the sheriff in town. India had to come to terms with reality. Liberalizing Indian markets and building up a strong tech industry saw global investment, especially American, pour into India. But that didn t mean the Americans were beginning a honeymoon period with India. Under Bill Clinton and his Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, India was witness to America s continued open support for Pakistan in the form of sanctions on nuclear tests (which, in fairness, also applied to Pakistan for its test) but also for America s support for Pakistani demands in Kashmir. This, coupled with the Indian army being reliant on Russian defense equipment, meant India had to hedge its bets appropriately. This is where, I believe, India abandoned its cause of non-alignment that is, trying to avoid being on the side of one superpower against another and began its approach towards multi-alignment; that is, having diplomatic relations with countries on an individual basis, and working towards mutual interests while trying to recognize and respect differences. Thus, America s sanctions on India were waived, a nuclear deal was signed, Indian-American trade blossomed, and India began indulging in the purchases of American weaponry. India and the US have similar concerns about a belligerent China in the Indo-Pacific region, and the resurgence of the QUAD (the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between India, the US, Australia and Japan) under Donald Trump further signaled progressing ties between the two. India also began cultivating better ties with the UK and the EU, focusing mainly on improving trade relations but also on buying more French weaponry, such as the recent deal to acquire Dassault Rafale fighter jets. As of today, India s largest trading partners are the US, EU, and China. But, at the same time, India maintained tight relations with Moscow. Defense deals for fighter jets, joint development of cruise missiles like the Brahmos, technology transfers, production of T90 tanks, and, most recently, the purchase of S400s air defense systems and possibly even the S550s, show that at least in terms of defense cooperation, India s relationship with Russia has witnessed almost no speed bumps. Furthermore, the two are also part of the BRICS economic bloc and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which further goes on to show New Delhi s balancing act and its commitment to multi-alignment. So that s pretty much why New Delhi s neutral stance towards this conflict shouldn t come as a surprise to the West, not that the West has ever taken India s side in relation to issues like Pakistan. But the aforementioned reasons weren t the only ones why New Delhi chose to abstain; there was more at play. One of the top destinations for Indian students to study medicine abroad is Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. So, naturally, when the war began, India s first priority was to evacuate its citizens stuck in a warzone. India has had considerable success in the past with such evacuation missions (Kuwait, Yemen, Libya, etc), not only for its own but sometimes also for citizens of neighboring countries like Nepal. Abstaining at the UN was meant to signal neutrality so as to allow both sides in the war to grant safe passage to evacuating Indian nationals. This is where India s multi-aligned foreign policy helped. Countries bordering Ukraine such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia all maintain cordial relations with New Delhi. They were quick to assist in hosting Indian students in their territory, with Poland extending its hand so far as to waive visa restrictions for Indians. Similarly, many Indian students were also evacuated with the help of Moscow and the Russian Army. However, there were countlessaccounts of harassmenton the part of the Ukrainian army and Neo-Nazis, not only against Indians, but also against Africans. Ultimately all Indian students managed to escape because India was able to maintain friendly relations with all sides. International students being used as hostage population/bargaining chips.""This student is saying in Gujarati that he has learnt that Ukraine army have been told not to let Indians cross the border until the Indian government helps Ukraine."" -@SanksPpic.twitter.com/Xea6FuzPrW Another area where its foreign policy helped was in purchasing oil. Due to sanctions on Russia, buying oil became more difficult and was further exacerbated by Brent Crude almost touching $140/barrel on March 8). India needed to diversify its oil dependency and also to seek cheaper sources of fuel. Ultimately, because India maintained neutrality at the UN and cordial relations with Russia for decades, Russia initially offered India a 20% discount on oil prices, which the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation happily grabbed. Now, reports suggest that Russia hasofferedIndia oil at a $35/barrel discount to pre-war prices (so, around $65/barrel), and in a proposed Rupee-Ruble mechanism, which Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov discussed on his latest visit to New Delhi. Although the initial deal was for only three million barrels (India s daily consumption is around 4.5 million barrels itself), it helped pave the way for future deals and contracts to be negotiated on more favorable terms for both sides. Other companies, like Hindustan Petroleum and Nayara Energy, have also reportedlybegunpurchasing Russian oil for a start. There are evenreportsthat India could import more than 15 million barrels in total from Russia this year, as it hasalready importedclose to 13 million barrels in the first quarter alone. Continuing this relationship could give Indian industries a competitive edge, due to lower input costs and Indian citizens access to cheaper fuel as global costs and inflation skyrocket. This development comes as India islooking intothe Rupee-Ruble mechanism for the entirety of trade between the two countries, while Russia has evenofferedan alternative to the SWIFT bank-transfer system to conduct transactions, which could begin the end for the financial unipolarity of the US Dollar and American finance. While all of this occurred, the West was understandably angry. The constant colonial condescension accelerated to a fever pitch; uninformed op-eds in the Western press attacked India for‚Äúsliding into authoritarianism‚Äùbecause it was buying Russian energy, disregarding that the EU was also buying Russian energy. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss initially also pressured India to condemn Russia, while just five months previously she d refused to condemn terrorism from Pakistan on Indian soil, to the Indian media, in India! Today the British Trade sec expressed disappointment at India's stance on üá∑üá∫-üá∫üá¶ conflict.When many in üáÆüá≥ ask ""why dont you speak up when it's us"", I see many in the West scoff and give excuses. Please look at this 5 month old interview of Liz Truss and tell me what's missing.https://t.co/ADlXA2J5im There were even weird remarks by US President Biden, whosaidthat India was‚Äúshaky‚Äùwith regards to this crisis. But, besides such remarks, which I am sure most Indians and Indian foreign policy analysts must have gotten used to by now, there was no concrete action taken by the West against India (yet). While CAATSA sanctions are still on the table for India s purchase of Russian S400s, there has been a quiet acceptance of India asserting its geopolitical clout and securing its interests. This further highlights the positives of India s multi-aligned foreign policy. In sum, by maintaining cordial relations with almost all sides in the conflict, India was able to not only evacuate its citizens largely safely, but was also able to initiate purchases of discounted Russian crude and continue the development the Rupee-Ruble mechanism, all while not bearing any significant blowback from the West (but instead finding open support for its citizens from EU countries like Poland, Hungary, and Romania). This shows that India is on the right path moving forward, being a party to both BRICS and the QUAD, and can secure its own interests on its own terms.",https://www.rt.com/news/553261-india-balanced-russia-west-conflict/
"4 Apr, 2022",Number of IS sympathizers inside Israel revealed media,"The country has recently been hit with a string of terrorist attacks, in which eleven people were killed Defense officials estimate that some 200 Israeli citizens of Arab origin identify with Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and at least 20 of them are capable of carrying out an attack, according to the local Haaretz newspaper. The Israeli military shared the numbers obtained through monitoring social media and other intelligence activities with Israeli politicians on Sunday, the outlet reported. Six Israeli Arabs who identify with IS have already been placed under movement restrictions, with more such orders to follow, the defense officials allegedly said. They revealed that a few dozen Israeli citizens have traveled to Syria, Iraq, and Egypt s Sinai Peninsula to join the ranks of IS there. Several of them have already been killed in the fighting, while the rest are being slated for arrest as soon as they try to make it back to Israel, according to the report. The defense officials have also asked the government to ban the Israeli public from uploading videos from the scene of terrorist incidents on social media, calling such clips a driver for copycat attacks, Haaretz said. Israel and the occupied West Bank saw a spike in violence in past two weeks, with 11 people losing their lives in terrorist attacks. On March 22, an IS sympathizer ran a cyclist over with his car, killing the man, then stabbed three people to death outside a shopping mall in Beersheba. Several days later, two Israeli police officers were shot dead in a gun attack that was also claimed by IS. Last week, a Palestinian with no known links to the group gunned down five people in a Tel Aviv suburb before being killed by the police.

"30 Mar, 2022",Russian grain union wants to switch export payments to rubles,"Western sanctions prompt agriculture exporters to find solutions to minimize risks The Russian Union of Grain Exporters (Rusgrain) has turned to the Bank of Russia to get the necessary tools to start selling domestic produce for rubles. The measure was discussed at the regulator s meeting with the alliance, according to the list of initiatives obtained by business daily Kommersant. Rusgrain, which accounts for more than 70% of Russian grain exports, has asked the regulator to provide ruble liquidity for foreign banks that serve the buyers of the country s grains. The current contracts currently permits all transactions to be made in foreign currency, sources close to the union told the media, adding that the Ukrainian conflict that led to the fresh wave of anti-Russian sanctions has posed serious challenges to obtaining those payments. Market participants are facing serious restrictions on logistics, insurance and payment for grain, according to the Rusgrain Chairman Eduard Zernin, who said that the union had to turn to the central bank to avoid supplies being disruped. Since March 10, Russia has exported 28.1 million tons of grain, including 23 million tons of wheat, which is about 30% lower compared to the same period in 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture reported. Turkey, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia are currently the main importers of Russian grain. Russia and Turkey have reportedly had success in ruble settlements. The scheme is expected to significantly facilitate trade with Iran. On Monday, the chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin called for switching to ruble settlements for exports in other Russian commodities, such as fertilisers, seed oil, crude, coal, metals, wood and grains. The initiative follows Moscow's March 31 deadline for hostile countries to begin payments for Russian natural gas imports in rubles. ",https://www.rt.com/business/552962-russia-grain-exports-ruble/
"30 Mar, 2022",Salah targeted by laser attack before penalty miss in World Cup defeat (VIDEO),"Egypt s World Cup dreams were shattered in a penalty shootout defeat to Senegal Mo Salah was targeted with laser beams before blazing his penalty over the crossbar in Egypt s World Cup qualifying defeat in a controversial match against African rivals Senegal. Preparing to take his team s first penalty in the shootout in Dakar, Egyptian captain Salah was seen with green dots strewn across his face and body as fans in the stands directed laser pens at him. The Liverpool star fired his effort wildly over the bar before teammates Ahmed Sayed and Mostafa Mohamed also missed their spot kicks as Senegal won the shootout 3-1 to book a spot at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Salah was just one of a host of Egypt stars, including goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy, who were targeted with lasers throughout the encounter, starting as soon as the teams lined up for the pre-match anthems. The clash was a repeat of last month s Africa Cup of Nations final which Senegal also won on penalties but this time had a place in Qatar at stake. Egypt led the tie 1-0 on aggregate after the first leg in Cairo, but Senegal leveled the scoreline after just four minutes at the Diamniadio Olympic Stadium on Tuesday thanks to an own goal from Hamdi Fathi. In a contest blighted by fouls and gamesmanship, Senegal had much the better of the match, dominating possession and managing 25 shots but without making another breakthrough. Egypt substitute Zizo spurned two opportunities after being introduced in the 70th minute, while Senegal s Ismaila Sarr was also culpable of an extra-time miss as the tie headed to a shootout. All four of the first spot kicks were missed including Salah and Senegal skipper Kalidou Koulibaly before Sarr put Senegal ahead. Amr El Solia registered Egypt s first effort, but Bamba Dieng then made it 2-1 before Edouard Mendy saved from Mostafa Mohamed. Salah s Liverpool teammate Sadio Mane hit the decisive penalty as Senegal ensured they will make successive appearances at the World Cup finals following their trip to Russia four years ago. It will be the third time in the nation s history that they have reached the FIFA showpiece. Salah did not respond to the laser provocations but he and fellow Egypt stars were pelted with objects in fiery scenes as they left the pitch. The furious Egyptian FA claimed players had been targeted by racism from sections of the 50,000-strong crowd in Dakar as well as attacks prior to the match. The Egypt national team have been exposed to racism with offensive signs in the stands against the Egyptian players in general, and Mohamed Salah in particular, read a statement. The crowd also intimidated the players by throwing bottles and rocks on them during the warm-up. The Egyptian group s busses have also been exposed to assaults that led to broken windows and injuries; filed with pictures and videos as proof in the complaint submitted. Egypt failed to follow up their appearance in Russia, and will be forced to sit out a seventh World Cup out of the last eight editions of the tournament.

"28 Mar, 2022",Two Israelis killed in second IS rampage in a week,"The jihadist group claimed responsibility after a pair of gunmen shot dead two police officers in central Israel Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) claimed responsibility on Monday for a shooting in Negev that saw two Arab gunmen kill two Israeli police officers and wound four others in the second deadly rampage by the group within a week. The attack, which happened on Sunday, saw the shooters open fire on the eve of a meeting between the foreign ministers of four Arab nations and the United States in central Israel. Less than a week ago, a lone attacker, inspired by IS, murdered four people in a stabbing spree in the south of the country. Security footage showed two men opening fire in Hadera before they were shot by two members of the Israeli Border Police s counterterrorism unit who had been in a restaurant nearby when the attack began. The emergency services swiftly responded to the situation. This was murder for the sake of murder and terror for the sake of terror, Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said, flanked by ministers from Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, the UAE, and the US, adding that the terrorist goal is to intimidate us. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita addressed the terrorist attack, stating, Our presence here today is, I think, the best response to such attacks. IS claimed responsibility for the attack via its mouthpiece, Amaq, reporting that two jihadists had killed two members of the Israeli security forces. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said his heart breaks over the attacks, issuing a statement from his home, where he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. In contrast, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules neighboring Gaza, called it a heroic operation. The rampages come ahead of the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Citizens have been urged to remain vigilant and the police will be establishing checkpoints on major roads in the area from Tuesday. Ramadan, which begins on Saturday, has previously been a period in which violence has broken out between Israeli police and Muslim protesters.

"24 Mar, 2022",Leaders warn of unprecedented global food crisis risks,"The French president presented his own plan for food security and called on Russia to be responsible G7 leaders have called for an extraordinary session of the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization in a bid to prevent the Ukrainian conflict from turning into a global food crisis, while French President Emmanuel Macron presented his own initiative for food security. According to acommuniqueadopted on Thursday at the summit of the world s biggest economies, the Russian offensive on its neighboring country places global food security under increased pressure. Therefore, the G7 leaders agreed to use all instruments and funding mechanisms and involve the relevant international institutions to address food security, including support for the continued Ukrainian production efforts. We call for an extraordinary session of the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to address the consequences on world food security and agriculture arising from the Russian aggression against Ukraine, reads the communique. The countries agreed to avoid export bans and other trade-restrictive measures and to maintain open and transparent markets, in accordance with World Trade Organization rules. French President Emmanuel Macron has used the summit in Brussels to present his own initiative for food security. The world is facing an unprecedented food crisis, Macron said, adding that it is a direct consequence of Russia s choices and the war. In the president s opinion, the situation is already difficult and might further deteriorate in 12-18 months. Speaking at the press briefing, the French leader, who is regularly speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urged Moscow to be responsible and to allow Ukraine to continue sowing. Otherwise, he emphasized, the famine would be certainly inevitable in many countries, which are highly dependent on agricultural supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Among the countries most at risk, Macron mentioned Egypt, as well as some other countries in Africa and the Middle East. Macron s initiative for food security involves an emergency plan for the release of stocks in the event of a crisis, a multilateral commitment not to impose restrictions on the export of agricultural raw materials, a temporary increase in production thresholds, supporting sustainable food production in the most vulnerable countries, and creating a mechanism which would enable providing them with agricultural products in sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices, if such necessity arises. Food security was discussed on Thursday by other leaders as well, including US President Joe Biden. Macron has been warning about the global food crisis for some time and recently announced some domestic measures poised to mitigate the consequences of military action in Ukraine. Stressing that Ukraine and Russia are true barns for the international food supply, Macron, who is facing the election on April 10, said that he planned to introduce food vouchers to help the most modest households and the middle classes to face these additional costs. However, the details of a food support program are yet to be revealed. Russia and Ukraine are among the world s biggest crop suppliers. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the two countries represent 53% of global trade in sunflower oil and seeds and 27% in wheat. UNCTAD earlier said that all countries would inevitably be impacted by the conflict-generated crisis. Increases in food and fuel prices will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger, the organizationwarned. Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid. Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force.

"24 Mar, 2022",How the Ukraine conflict could affect African nations,"In the ongoing standoff between the West and the East, the continent has a vested interest in remaining neutral ByAndrey Maslov, the Director of the Centre for African Studies at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, andVsevolod Sviridov, a researcher at Intexpertise, the Department of African Studies, St. Petersburg State University Russia s military operation in Ukraine, launched in February, followed by the dramatic increase in tensions on the global scene will undoubtedly affect the economic and political landscape in Africa in the medium term, as well as the balance of external powers active on the continent and Africa s pace of development in key areas. Diplomatically, Africa has chosen to remain neutral on the subject of the conflict, alongside a large portion of the Global South nations. 26 out of 54 African statesdid not supportthe UN General Assembly s resolution to condemn Russia s actions in Ukraine. Eritrea voted against it, while 17 other African countries (out of 35 globally) abstained from the vote. TheseincludeAlgeria, Angola, Burundi, Zimbabwe, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa and South Sudan. Eight more nations did not vote: Burkina Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Eswatini and Ethiopia. Egypt, despite voicing its support of the resolution, is maintaining constructive cooperation with Russia anyway. No country on the African continent has so far joined the sanctions. Notably, both Senegal and Tanzania, continental economic leaders of the last decade, did not join its traditional trade and business partners to condemn Russia. Of no less significance is the statement that came from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa whosaidin parliament that the war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region. Since the launch of the special operation in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has held telephone talks with three African leaders: with President of Senegal Macky Sall (who is also the Chair of the African Union until February 2023), President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa. So far, according to the official statements, the situation has not changed any plans for the Second Russia Africa Summit - set to be held later this year. On March 3, Presidential Special Envoy for Africa and Middle East Mikhail Bogdanov told the Russian News Agency TASS that preparations are underway and the dates for the summit are yet to be announced. In the meantime, the military conflict, sanctions and economic measures introduced by the Russian government to stabilize the domestic market will no doubt have a significant effect on the African economies. Between 2015 and 2020, Russia and Ukraine supplied up to 25% of the total wheat imports into Africa. A series of consequences have hit the sector, including a potential temporary ban on wheat exports, disruption to the sowing season in Ukraine, delays with shipments via the Black Sea routes and a looming fertilizer crisis that might affect other key suppliers of wheat to Africa, such as France and Brazil. These issues pose a serious food security threat to a number of African nations, including Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Tanzania. At the same time, supply disruptions will affect African countries in different ways. For example, in Nigeria this problem can be solved relatively painlessly: wheat is a commodity with a flexible demand in the country, occupying a market share that s comparable with other crops, such as corn and cassava. In other areas, however, the situation not only threatens demand, but also challenges a number of business projects, such as large-scale investments in wheat and other crop storage infrastructure network, as some of these investment projects involve Russian businesses and funding. Another persistent problem is caused by the shortage of logistics corridors due to sanctions and restrictions. Currently, Russia is unable to run massive grain and fertilizer supplies via the Caspian Sea and Iran. A sector where Africa is also bound to feel the change is the energy market. On the one hand, Europe shunning Russian oil and gas leaves African nations such as Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria with an opportunity to step in and fill in the gap in the hydrocarbons exports. On the other hand, this opportunity, so far, seems to be strictly hypothetical since none of these nations have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunity within the next five years. Nigeria, for instance, lacks the capacity for free exports, while other nations, such as Algeria, Libya and to a lesser extent Egypt, might not have too much surplus natural gas and crude oil to sell. Another problem in this area that will have to be dealt with is the rising oil prices triggering the growth of oil product prices. Oil products are mostly imported by African nations, and this crisis is going to hit the nations that rely on imported diesel and residual fuel oil the hardest, such as West Africa. If the euro zone is engulfed by a crisis, a massive outflow of capital and a persistent economic confrontation with Russia might mean to Africa less economic and tech support from the EU and its member states. The future of infrastructure investment projects announced at the EU African Union Summit in February as part of the ambitiousGlobal Gateway Investment Packageis also questionable. In the medium term, the social and economic situation in West Africa is causing the biggest concern. This region has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic harder than others, and a new crisis hitting its food and energy security might further destabilize the regional political systems. The global crisis, once again, confirms Africa's critical dependence on events not directly related to it. The risk of such destabilization can be countered by investing in the localization of the production of the main commodity categories that are critical for the continental economy: fertilizers, oil products, and food. In the developing stand-off between the West and the East, Africa will try to remain above the battle, metaphorically speaking. It most probably won t have to step up its budget spending on defense. To achieve that, it just needs to make sure the US-Russia-China confrontation steers clear of the African Continent and to try to maintain its neutral status, remaining united in the process which is currently an issue, as the recent UN vote has shown.",https://www.rt.com/news/552564-ukraine-conflict-african-nations-consequences/

While Tel Aviv has yet to comment on the purported trip, two unnamed Egyptian security sourcestoldReuters that Bennett traveled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday for trilateral talks with his Egyptian and Emirati counterparts. The report was corroborated by political and diplomatic sources reached by theTimes of Israel, theJerusalem Post, andHaaretz. Bennett, along with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, met to discuss shared security interests, of which there are quite a few, in all their aspects, one diplomat told the Post. Haaretz, meanwhile, reported that the visit was part of an attempt to form a coalition between countries that were previously considered rivals, among them Israel and a series of Arab states mainly as a way to oppose Iran. Bennett and Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid issued ajoint statementlast Friday urging Washington not to lift a terrorist designation for Iran s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which was placed on the sanctions blacklist by former President Donald Trump. We find it hard to believe that the IRGC s designation as a terrorist organization will be removed in exchange for a promise not to harm Americans, the officials said, asking the United States not to abandon its closest allies for such empty assurances. Similar concerns have reportedly been raised by the UAE, with one source based in Abu Dhabitellingthe Post that officials are in great shock over discussions about removing the IRGC from the terrorism list. Along with Israel and Saudi Arabia, the UAE is one of Iran s top regional rivals.

"20 Feb, 2022",Big bank s dealings with strongmen and spies exposed,"Leaked data exposed accounts of thousands of Credit Suisse clients all across the globe Credit Suisse reportedly served a motley client roster that included heads of state and spy chiefs, as well as sanctioned individuals and allegedly corrupt officials, according to a rare data leak from the Swiss banking giant. The revelations are based on data from more than 18,000 bank accounts that held upward of $100 billion combined between the 1940s and the 2010s. The information was leaked by a self-described whistleblower to Germany sSuddeutsche Zeitungnewspaper and shared with other media outlets, which nicknamed the trove Suisse secrets. Account holders included Jordan s King Abdullah II and the sons of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, according to theNew York Times, one of the outlets that received the data. The Mubarak brothers allegedly held six accounts, including one that amassed $196 million as of 2003. Spymasters who stashed money at Credit Suisse reportedly included the late Omar Suleiman of Egypt and Jordan s Saad Kheir. The latter started compiling millions of dollars at Credit Suisse after the US invaded Iraq in 2003. In 1985, when then-Pakistani intelligence chief Akhtar Abdur Rahman Khan was helping to funnel billions of dollars in aid to Mujahideen militants in Afghanistan, a Credit Suisse account was apparently opened in the names of his sons. A businessman who had been sanctioned by US and European governments for his ties to then-Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe also was on the bank s client roster. Another controversial account holder was Nervis Villalobos, Venezuela s former energy minister. Credit Suisse in 2011 opened an account for Villalobos, holding as much as $10 million, despite knowing of corruption allegations against him, the Times said. In fact, the bank allegedly hosted 25 accounts holding a combined $270 million for people accused of being involved in a conspiracy related to Venezuela s state oil company. Bank spokeswoman Candice Sun told the newspaper that many of the accounts referenced in the data leak date back decades, to a time where laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now. Many of the accounts cited in the leak have been closed, she said, and with those that remain active, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control-related steps were taken, including pending account closures.

"16 Feb, 2022",EU Commission president makes Russian gas claim,"As things stand, the bloc buys more than 40% of its gas from Moscow ByAilis Halligan The EU has measures in place that would ensure a stable energy supply in the event of an interruption in gas imports from Russia, the head of the European Commission declared on Tuesday. Speaking to the press, President Ursula von der Leyen dismissed the claim that the EU would be unable to cope should Russia turn off the pipes. Moscow currently supplies the bloc with approximately 40% of its natural gas. Our models now show that for partial disruption or further decrease of gas deliveries by Gazprom, we are now rather on the safe side, she said, according to Reuters news agency. Patrick Pouyanna, CEO of the French oil and gas company TotalEnergies, claimed earlier this month that the EU currently has no alternative to Russian gas and stated that maintaining a dialogue with Russian suppliers would be essential for the bloc s survival this winter. Despite its current dependence on Russia, von der Leyen revealed yesterday that the EU has engaged in discussion with multiple other countries, including the US, Qatar, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Nigeria, and South Korea, about the possibility of an increase in the supply of natural gas, including liquified (LNG) form. We also spoke with the main LNG suppliers... and asked whether we could swap contracts in favor of the EU, she explained. In particular, she highlighted that the Japanese government had expressed a willingness to cooperate and last week said it would divert some LNG shipments to Europe. According to von der Leyen, despite improvements in the continent s energy infrastructure over recent years allowing for more effective inter-country energy distribution, a stoppage in Russia-EU gas flow would still warrant alarm. Japan s promised contribution indicates that European efforts in reaching out to suppliers further afield are now distinctly paying off, she added. Von der Leyen said the need for Europe to reduce its dependence on Moscow had been highlighted by the alleged buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, with fears that an invasion could lead to the pipes being turned off. The transition away from Russian gas would also coincide with a wider EU objective to shift to 32% renewable energy by 2030, she noted.

Sankar also accused cryptocurrencies of at least potentially facilitating anti-social activities, and warned that they would wreck the currency system, the monetary authority, the banking system, and in general government's ability to control the economy if left to continue. India has the highest number of cryptocurrency owners in the world at more than 100 million, or roughly 7.3% of the country s population,accordingto cryptocurrency payments service TripleA. Several countries already have bans on cryptocurrency, including Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, and China. Earlier this month, Indian Finance Secretary T V Somanathanvowedthat cryptocurrency would never be a legal tender in India, unlike El Salvador, which became thefirstcountry in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender last year. Legal tender means by law it is accepted in settlement of debts. India will not be making any crypto asset as a legal tender, he said, concluding that only the Indian rupee would be legal tender in India.

"15 Feb, 2022",Israel offers Arab state the opportunity to tackle Iran together,"Naftali Bennett has become the first Israeli prime minister ever to visit Bahrain Since Israel and Bahrain both view Iran as a threat, they could team up and counter Tehran together, Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said on his landmark visit to the Gulf monarchy. We will fight Iran and its followers in the region night and day. We will aid our friends in strengthening peace, security, and stability, whenever we are asked to do so, Bennett pledged in an interview with the Bahraini state-linked Al-Ayyam outlet on Tuesday. The PM blamed Tehran of striving to destroy moderate states in the Gulf region in order to replace them with bloodthirsty terrorist groups. When asked about the possibility of creating an alliance to resist Iranian influence, which could include Israel, Bahrain, and some other Arab nations, he gave a positive response: We all understand that we face the same challenges, so why not work together to tackle them? Bennet, who became the first Israeli prime minister ever to visit Bahrain, assured the journalists that Israel is a strong and reliable country. The idea of such a block was first floated by Israeli general Tal Kelman last year. According to Kelman, who heads the IDF s Strategy and Third Circle Directorate, the moderate axis of Israel, Bahrain, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt and others should resist the radical axis of Iran and what he called its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Israel and Bahrain normalized relations in late 2020 as part of the so-called Abraham Accords, a US-backed drive to improve ties between the Jewish state and some Arab countries after decades of strife. Bahrain is a small island nation of around 1.5 million. The majority of its population is Shia Muslims, but the country is being run by a Sunni monarchy. The rulers in Manama have been concerned by Tehran s activities as Iran, which is located less than 800 kilometers (497 miles) away, often faces accusations from its rivals of supporting Shia groups in other countries.

"14 Feb, 2022",Chris Hedges: US traditionally solves domestic political crises by waging war,"War is used to divert American public attention from government corruption and incompetence Chris Hedgesis a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and host of RT s On Contact, a weekly interview series on US foreign policy, economic realities and civil liberties in American society. He s the author of 14 books, including several New York Times best-sellers. Chris Hedgesis a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and host of RT s On Contact, a weekly interview series on US foreign policy, economic realities and civil liberties in American society. He s the author of 14 books, including several New York Times best-sellers. The US is a de facto one-party state where the ideology of national security is sacrosanct, unsustainable debt props up the empire, and the primary business is war. When all else fails, when you are clueless about how to halt a 7.5% inflation rate, when your Build Back Better bill is gutted, when you renege on your promise to raise the minimum wage or forgive student debt, when you can t halt the Republican suppression of voting rights, when you have no idea how to handle the pandemic which has claimed 900,000 lives 16% of the world s total deaths although we are less than 5% of its population when the stock market fluctuates on wild rollercoaster rides of highs and lows, when what little help the government offered to the labor force half of whom, 80 million, experienced a period of unemployment last year sees the termination of the extended unemployment benefits, rental assistance, forbearance for student loans, emergency checks, the moratorium on evictions and expansion of the child tax credits, when you watch passively as the ecocide gathers momentum, then you must make the public afraid of enemies, foreign and domestic. You must manufacture an existential threat. Terrorists at home. Russians and Chinese abroad. Expand state power in the name of national security. Beat the drums of war. War is the antidote to divert public attention from government corruption and incompetence. No one plays the game better than the Democratic Party. The Democrats, as journalist and co-founder of Black Agenda Report Glen Ford said, are not the lesser evil, they are the more effective evil. The US, burdened by de facto tax boycotts by the rich and corporations, is sinking in debt, the highest in our history. The US government budget deficit was $2.77 trillion for the 2021 budget year that ended Sept. 30, the second highest annual deficit on record. It was exceeded only by the $3.13 trillion deficit for 2020. Total US national debt is over $30 trillion. Household debt grew by $1 trillion last year. The total debt balance in our government Ponzi scheme is now $1.4 trillion higher than it was at the end of 2019. Our wars are waged on borrowed money. The Watson Institute at Brown University estimates that interest payments on the military debt could be over $6.5 trillion by the 2050s. None of this debt is sustainable. At the same time, the US is facing the ascendency of China, whose economy is projected toovertake the US economy by the end of the decade. Washington s slew of desperate financial tricks flooding the global market with new dollars and lowering interest rates to near zero staved off major depressions after the 2000 dot.com crash, 9/11 and the 2008 global financial meltdown. The cheap interest rates led corporations and banks to borrow massively from the Federal Reserve, often to paper over shortfalls and bad investments. The result is that US businesses are deeper in debt than at any time in US history. Added to this morass is rising inflation, caused by businesses that have increased prices in a desperate effort to make up for lost revenue from supply chain shortages and rising shipping costs, the economic downturn and the slight wage increases triggered by the pandemic. This inflation has forced the Fed to curtail the growth of the money supply and raise interest rates, which then pushes corporations to further raise prices. The desperate measures to stave off an economic crisis are self-defeating. The bag of tricks is empty. Massive defaults on mortgages, student loans, credit cards, household debt, car debt and other loans in the United States is probably inevitable. With no short-term mechanisms left to paper over the disaster, it will usher in a prolonged depression. An economic crisis means a political crisis. And a political crisis is traditionally solved by war against enemies inside and outside the nation. The Democrats are as guilty of this as the Republicans. Wars can get started by Democrats, such as Harry S. Truman in Korea or John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam, and perpetuated by Republicans. Or they can get started by Republicans, such as George W. Bush, and perpetuated by Democrats such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Bill Clinton, without declaring war, imposed punishing sanctions on Iraq and authorized the Navy and the Air Force to carry out tens of thousands of sorties against the country, dropping thousands of bombs and launching hundreds of missiles. The war industry, with its $768 billion military budget, along with the expansion of Homeland Security, the FBI, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the National Security Agency, is a bipartisan project. The handful of national political leaders, such as Henry Wallace in 1948 and George McGovern in 1972, who dared to challenge the war machine were ruthlessly hounded into political oblivion by the leaders of both parties. Biden s bellicose rhetoric towards China and especially Russia, more strident than that of the Trump administration, has been accompanied by the formation of new security alliances such as those with India, Japan, Australia, and Great Britain in the Indo-Pacific. US aggression has, ironically, pushed China and Russia into a forced marriage, something the architects of the Cold War, including Nixon and Kissinger with their opening to China in 1971, worked very hard to avoid. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, after meeting recently in Beijing,issued a 5,300-word statementthat condemned NATO expansion in eastern Europe, denounced the formation of security blocs in the Asia Pacific region, and criticizedthe AUKUS trilateral security pactbetween the US, Great Britain and Australia. They also vowed to thwart color revolutions and strengthen back-to-back strategic coordination. Warmongering by the Democrats always comes wrapped in the mantle of democracy, freedom and human rights, making Democrats the more effective salespeople for war. Democrats eagerly lined up behind George W. Bush during the calls to invade Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of humanitarian intervention and liberating the women of Afghanistan, who would spend the next two decades living in terror, burying family members, at times their children. Even when Democrats, including Barack Obama, criticized the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq while running for office, they steadfastly voted to fund the wars to support our troops once elected. Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA),says an assault on Ukraine is an assault on democracy, the same argument Democrats clung to a half-century ago while launching and expanding the disastrous war in Vietnam. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, is currently crafting legislation he proudly calls the mother of all sanctions bill. The bill led in the House by Gregory Meeks of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also a Democrat, demands that the administration not cede to the demands of the Russian Federation regarding NATO membership or expansion. NATO expansion to Ukraine along Russia s borders is the central issue for Moscow. Removing this for discussion obliterates a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Sanctions under the legislation can be imposed for any act, no matter how minor, deemed by Ukraine to be hostile. The sanctions cannot be lifted until an agreement is reached between the government of Ukraine and Russia, meaning Ukraine would be granted the authority to determine when the US sanctions will end. The proposed sanctions, which target Russian banks, the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, state-owned enterprises and leading members of the government and military, including President Vladimir Putin, also call for blocking Russia from SWIFT, the international financial transaction system that uses the US dollar as the world s reserve currency. The legislation would grant at least $500 million in foreign military assistance to Ukraine, in addition to the $200 million in new assistance sent over the last month, writes Marcus Stanley.¬† This makes Ukraine the third leading recipient of US military assistance globally, after Israel, and Egypt. While it wouldn t come close to giving Ukraine the ability to combat Russia on its own, it may come with US military advisors that would increase the danger the US would be drawn into a conflict. The bill also takes steps to directly involve countries bordering Russia in negotiations to end the crisis, which would make it much more difficult to reach an agreement. While cutting Russia off from SWIFT will be catastrophic, at least in the short term, for the Russian economy, pushing Russia into the arms of China to create an alternative global financial system that no longer relies on the US dollar will cripple the American empire. Once the dollar is no longer the world s reserve currency the dollar will precipitously drop in value, perhaps as much as by two-thirds, as the pound sterling did when the British currency was abandoned as the world s reserve currency in the 1950s. Treasury bonds, used to finance America s military-based balance-of-payments deficit and the ballooning government budget deficit, will no longer be attractive investments for countries such as China. The nearly 800 US military outposts abroad, sustained by debt the Chinese have lent an estimated $1 trillion to the US on which they collect hefty interest will dramatically shrink in number. Meanwhile, the massive US interest payments, at least in part, will continue to fund the Chinese military. The US domination of the world economy, after 75 years, is over. It is not coming back. We manufacture little, short of weapons. Our economy is a mirage built on unsustainable levels of debt. The pillage orchestrated by the capitalist elites and corporations has hollowed the country out from the inside, leaving the infrastructure decayed, democratic institutions moribund and at least half the population struggling at subsistence level. The two ruling parties, puppets for the ruling oligarchs, refuse to curb the rapacious appetites of the war industry and the rich, accelerating the crisis. That the rage of the dispossessed is legitimate, even if it is expressed in inappropriate ways, is never acknowledged by the Democrats, who were instrumental in pushing through the trade deals, deindustrialization, tax loopholes for the rich, deficit spending, endless wars and austerity programs that have created crisis. Instead, shooting the messenger, the Biden administration is targeting Trump supporters and winning draconian sentences for those who stormed the Capitol on January 6. Biden s Justice Department has formed a domestic terrorism unit to focus on extremists and Democrats have been behind a series of moves to de-platform and censor their right-wing critics. The belief that the Democratic Party offers an alternative to militarism is, as Samuel Johnson said, the triumph of hope over experience. The disputes with Republicans are largely political theater, often centered around the absurd or the trivial. On the substantive issues there is no difference within the ruling class. The Democrats, like the Republicans, embrace the fantasy that, even as the country stands on the brink of insolvency, a war industry that has orchestrated debacle after debacle, from Vietnam to Afghanistan and Iraq, is going to restore lost American global hegemony. Empires, as Reinhold Niebuhr observed, eventually destroy themselves in the effort to prove that they are indestructible. The self-delusion of military invincibility is the scourge that brought down the American empire, as it brought down past empires. We live in a one-party state. The ideology of national security is sacrosanct. The cult of secrecy, justified in the name of protecting us from our enemies, is a smoke screen to hide from the public the inner workings of power and manipulate public perceptions. The Democratic courtiers and advisers that surround any Democratic presidential candidate the retired generals and diplomats, the former national security advisers, the Wall Street economists, the lobbyists, and the apparatchiks from past administrations do not want to curb the power of the imperial presidency. They do not want to restore the system of checks and balances. They do not want to challenge the military or the national security state. They are the system. They want to move back into the White House to wield its awful force. And now, with Joe Biden, that is where they are.",https://www.rt.com/news/549363-war-political-crisis-democrats/
"9 Feb, 2022",EU reportedly pushes for new pandemic prevention treaty,"Document may include ban on wildlife markets and new virus detection initiatives The European Union is planning to start negotiations on a new pandemic prevention initiative that could introduce a gradual ban on wildlife markets and rewards for countries that report new viruses or variants, according to an unnamed EU official who spoke to Reuters. A meeting will take place on Wednesday for initial talks, and officials are aiming to have produced a first draft of the agreement by August. The upcoming discussions will require the presence of delegates from six major countries in the main regions of the world, which include Japan, Brazil, Egypt, Thailand, South Africa, and the EU, which will be represented by a delegate from the Netherlands. Among the preventive measures that could be proposed during the negotiations is a gradual shutdown of wildlife markets, since the most widely accepted theory suggests the current Covid-19 pandemic began after the SARS-CoV-2 virus was transmitted from an animal to humans at a Chinese wet market. Another initiative includes incentives for those who report new viruses or variants, with the aim of avoiding cover-ups and ensuring the timely prevention of disease proliferation. According to the EU official cited by Reuters, they could guarantee access to medication and vaccines, as well as other supportive measures for countries that detect and share new information about possible outbreaks. EU officials apparently also have plans to introduce legally binding obligations to report virus outbreaks. The countries could also negotiate a revision of global healthcare rules and amendments to the International Health Regulations, a set of guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. If the parties reach an agreement, the new initiative on pandemic prevention is expected to be completed by May 2024. Brussels proposed the launch of negotiations on the new pandemic prevention initiative backed by the World Health Organization in 2021. However, since then the EU has been struggling to get approval from other major countries, notably Brazil, India and the US, which wanted the agreement to be non-binding.

"8 Feb, 2022",Salah vows revenge in rallying cry (VIDEO),"Liverpool's Egyptian ace Mo Salah says his team will take 'revenge' on their AFCON conquerors Senegal when the two sides meet again next month Liverpool's Egyptian king Mo Salah has called upon his teammates to exact a measure of revenge against Sadio Mane and his Senegalese teammates when they meet again next month after Egypt were defeated in the Africa Cup on Nations final by the slimmest of margins. A decisive spot kick from Salah's Liverpool teammate Mane was enough to claim Senegal's first ever triumph in African football's showpiece game last weekend - with Salah not even getting the opportunity to take a penalty after two his teammates fluffed their lines from the penalty spot beforehand. A dejected Salah was commiserated by Sane in the immediate aftermath of the dramatic penalty shootout, but despite his club colleague's act of sportsmanship, Salah told his teammates afterwards in the locker room that they must avenge the loss next month. Even with his clear disappointment in losing the AFCON final, Mo Salah was still rallying his teammates with a speech in the dressing room after the game.What a leader ‚ù§Ô∏èpic.twitter.com/1l8k3tggpO As fate would have it, Egypt and Senegal are to meet in a two-legged World Cup qualifier on March 23 and 29 - and as Salah told his teammates after their penalty shootout loss, failure isn't an option this time around. I want to thank you for these performances, you all gave your best. We played four matches all 120 minutes in about 12 days, Salah told his teammates in a clip which has been leaked to social media, aftertranslation. But it's in the past now, we have the games against them next month and god willing, we will take revenge on them. The game is again a high stakes affair, with the winners getting a place in this year's World Cup in Qatar. The first leg will take place in Cairo, with the return leg kicking off in Dakar six days later. Between now and then, however, both Salah and Mane will be required to get back onto the same page as Liverpool face a pivotal list of fixtures starting this weekend against Premier League side Leicester before an away Champions League trip to Italian champions Inter Milan next week. Salah has been enjoying a tremendous season in the English top flight. His 16 Premier League goals have him far ahead of his rivals in the race for the Golden Boot in what has been another exemplary season on Merseyside for the Egyptian star. However, Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp face an anxious wait to see if Salah will agree terms on a new contract at Anfield lest they face the prospect of losing their top star to free agency when his current deal expires in the summer of 2023. But if there was something of a sour mood in Cairo after the AFCON final, it was considerably less so in Senegal when the champions returned home - with Chelsea goalkeeper and penalty shootout hero Edouard Mendy capturing the raucous reaction when they paraded the trophy to throngs of delighted fans in Dakar.

"7 Feb, 2022",Spotify censored my Saudi-blasting Rogan appearance Kyle Kulinski,"The progressive commenter said his talking about Jamal Khashoggi murder and Yemen war crimes may have caused old episode s removal Spotify appears to have censored an old episode of the Joe Rogan Experience show over criticism voiced in it against Saudi Arabia, the featured guest has alleged on Monday. Kyle Kulinsky pointed out that the Arab kingdom is a promising new market for the audio streaming company. Kulinski, who hosts his own Secular Talk show on YouTube, has been invited to Rogan s on several occasions throughout the years. The episode that gotaxedby Spotify last week was aired in October 2018. Among the contemporary news that he and Rogandiscussedlive on air was the murder of dissident Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Many people believed from the start that the hit was ordered by Saudi Arabia s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Riyadh tried and sentenced a group of government operatives, who, the kingdom claimed, had gone rogue before killing the self-exiled Saudi reporter. The guest of the Rogan show outlined the circumstances of Khashoggi's death at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, which were known by that time. Then he ramped up criticisms of Riyadh for allegedly committing war atrocities amid its devastating military intervention in Yemen and other misdeeds. My 2018 Joe Rogan Experience appearance was CENSORED by@Spotify. He didn't use any racial slurs in the episode. I RAILED against Saudi Arabia in it and Spotify just happened to expand into the Saudi market at the exact time that coincides with the banning (1/2)pic.twitter.com/R0bZxDvVEf Rogan didn t use any racial slurs in the episode, Kulinski assured followers on Twitter, adding that Spotify just happened to expand into the Saudi market at the exact time that coincides with the banning. He cited a recentreportby Reuters, which explained how the controversy over Rogan's podcast could affect Spotify s market value and its plans to conquer new markets. The Swedish company expanded its paid podcast subscriptions in 33 more markets and enabled podcasts for users in Russia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the agency said. Spotify has felt pressure from local competition in the Arab world recently. Anghami, a UAE-based rival streaming service,soaredmore than 80% in its Nasdaq debut last Friday after a $220 million merger. Meanwhile, Spotify's shares suffered a rapid drop amid the Rogan controversy. There has long been animosity towards Rogan s show among some parts of the US establishment, with people criticizing him and demanding his deplatforming, for various reasons. The latest wave of anger was triggered by his hosting of controversial doctors who hold highly skeptical views about Covid-19 mandates. As Spotify was pressured by the public and the White House, the company issued a new policy on content about Covid-19, promising to add advisories and links to trusted sources on the pandemic. The host himself acknowledged some of the criticism, saying he should have done a better job at inviting people with opposing views shortly after having someone controversial on his show. The subsequent purge of past episodes was about more than just alleged misinformation. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said it was Rogan s decision to remove them and cited the history of using some racially insensitive language. It was apparently a reference to a compilation of Rogan using the N-word in the past, which circulated on the social media after Spotify refused to deplatform his show. Rogan s defendersrespondedby bringing up footage of Joe Biden using the racial slur decades ago to back the podcaster spositionthat the context in which the word is said should be taken into account. Spotify s Ek condemned the use of the N-word, and said that, while some people would want to see more done about Rogan, I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer.

A decisive shootout penalty from Salah's Liverpool colleague Sadio Mane was enough to claim a famous win for Senegal in African football's showpiece game but before the game went down to the wire, Salah's on-field protests were likely the most contentious incidents of a tight opening period. After complaining about a yellow card being shown to one of his teammates, Salah was put in his place by the match official Victor Gomes who offered the Egyptian talisman his cards and his whistle, apparently asking the Liverpool man if he would like to officiate the game himself.

Salah's frustrations continued after the final whistle when his Liverpool strike partner Mane sank the title-winning penalty after neither side could be separated after 120 minutes of action. But despite Salah's disappointment, several fans on Twitter couldn't help but revel in seeing one of the world's best players being told off by the referee.

It must ve been confusing for him (and Mane too) when every slight touch and dramatic dive didn t result in a penalty."" A third showed off some rudimentary photoshop skills by switching Salah's head on to the match referee's body. And if any ignominy remains between both Salah and Mane after their penalty shootout rivalry in Cameroon late on Sunday, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will be hoping that those sentiments don't join them on the plane back to England with both in contention to make their return to the Reds' starting lineup ahead of Thursday fixture with Leicester City.

"1 Feb, 2022",German government approves $2.48bn new arms sales,"It took the new government in Berlin only weeks to approve arms exports worth almost as much as those greenlit by the previous cabinet over six months in 2021 In the seven weeks since taking office, the new German government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz s Social Democrats, has greenlit arms exports totaling 2.2 billion ($2.48 billion) almost as much as ex-chancellor Angela Merkel s cabinet approved over the first six months of 2021. At the time, Merkel s government approved 2.3 billion ($2.59 billion) worth of arms sales. The new figures prompted some German media, including RP Online, to suggest that the Scholz government is on its way toward a new arms exports record. Merkel s government set its own record last year right before their term was due to expire. In the last nine days in office, her cabinet approved arms sales to the tune of nearly $5 billion, bringing the total amount of the nation s arms exports in 2021 to 9.35 billion ($10.53 billion). The new coalition government, made up of the Social Democrats, the Greens, and the Free Democrats, had vowed to re-examine the previous cabinet s arms export policies. In December, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called it a matter not only of economy but of foreign policy, human rights and international relations. Scholz s government also announced it was working on a new arms control bill. Most of the newly-approved sales were destined for other EU nations, NATO members, and partners like Australia or New Zealand, according to the media, with only a tiny fraction of 0.1% being sold to third countries. The term refers to all non-EU and non-NATO nations that do not have the status of NATO allies like Australia, Japan or New Zealand. One deal with the Netherlands involves deliveries of artillery munitions for Dutch ammo depots and firing ranges and accounts for the lion s share of newly-approved exports at 1.79 billion ($2.02 billion). Arms worth hundreds of millions of euros are also being sold to Australia, while the US and UK will get German arms worth dozens of millions of euros. Sven Giegold, a parliamentary state secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs who is responsible for arms exports, told the dpa news agency that the sales were based on close security cooperation with European partners. In 2021, Egypt emerged as the top recipient of the German arms. The Arab nation was criticized over alleged human rights abuses and its involvement in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. Berlin still sold Cairo three navy ships and 16 air defense systems while Merkel was the German chancellor. The Social Democrats, which now lead the government coalition, were part of Merkel s cabinet at the time as well. The then-incumbent chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was a vice-chancellor and the finance minister in the previous government. ",https://www.rt.com/news/547978-germany-arms-exports-billions-approved/
"30 Jan, 2022","US teacher trained women, children to become ISIS suicide bombers FBI","American citizen believed to be a leader of an all-female military battalion charged with providing support to terrorists in Syria A 42-year-old US citizen, Allison Elizabeth Fluke-Ekren, has been captured in Syria and transferred into the custody of the FBI to appear before a Virginia court next week, the US Department of Justicedisclosedon Saturday. According to now unsealed documents, the woman, believed to be a former teacher, played an active role in helping Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists to train women and children as suicide bombers in Syria. Known by several names, including some Arabic, she also allegedly planned to carry out terrorist attacks on a college campus and a shopping mall in the US. Citing a report from a special agent who investigated the woman, including through information provided by a number of cooperating witnesses, US officials revealed that Fluke-Ekren allegedly organized and led an IS battalion, known as the Khatiba Nusaybah, which was composed solely of women. She trained them to use assault rifles, grenades and suicide belts, documents suggest, adding that over 100 women and young girls had been drilled by the US citizen on behalf of IS. Terrorist leaders were proud to have an American instructor, while she herself wished to engage in violent jihad, witnesses suggested. Children were also trained on the use of AK-47 assault rifles and suicide belts, the US Department of Justice stated in their report. Fluke-Ekren is now charged with providing material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, and faces up to 20 years behind bars. The woman who traveled from the US to Egypt in 2008, and then ended up in Syria after spending some time in Libya and Iraq has allegedly been involved with a number of terrorism-related activities on behalf of ISIS from at least 2014. A potential attack on a college campus in the US was among those activities. In a plot apparently approved by terrorist leaders, she planned to plant a backpack full of explosives on the campus grounds and flee. The attack planning was put on hold after she learned she was pregnant. In a different scenario, Fluke-Ekren allegedly told a witness about her desire to kill as many people as possible at a shopping mall in the US. To carry out the attack, she would have parked a vehicle full of explosives at the mall s underground parking and then remotely detonated it. She considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources, according to the documents. The former US teacher was radicalized to a level off the charts, according to a witness who interacted with her. Asked to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely radicalized, the witness gave her 11 or 12. Fluke-Ekren has been married several times and has multiple children, according to the investigation. One of her late husbands, who she met in the US, was a sniper trainer for IS, while another, also now dead, allegedly worked on a project involving drones carrying chemical weapons.

After January 30, the secretary intends to reprogram the $130 million to other national security priorities, it pointed out, without elaborating on what those priorities might be. In September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken greenlighted $300 million in foreign military aid to Egypt, but withheld another $130 million on condition that the country fulfilled specific human-rights related conditions by the end of January. The government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is accused of having enacted a large-scale crackdown in recent years on Islamist and secular activists involved in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. The arrest and prosecution of dissidents is believed to have been facilitated by the state of emergency that was imposed in Egypt in April 2017, after church bombings and deadly attacks on Coptic Christians. It had been prolonged several times over the years, with Sisi lifting the state of emergency only last October. During his phone call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Thursday, Blinken reaffirmed the importance of human rights in the bilateral relationship, according to the State Department. However, disagreements over human rights didn t prevent the Biden administration from approving a $2.5 billion sale of 12 Super Hercules C-130J transport aircraft and air defense radar systems to Egypt on Tuesday. The deal would support the foreign policy and national security of the US by helping to improve the security of a major non-NATO ally country that continues to be an important strategic partner in the Middle East, the State Department explained. It didn t mention the arms sale when announcing on Friday that military aid to Cairo would be cut. Egyptians are not thrilled to be deprived of $130 million, an unnamed senior State Department official told CNN. He insisted the decision on military aid and the arms sale were unrelated. There was no inconsistency in Washington s actions because we re letting them [Egypt] buy things that are in our interest, according to the official. State Department spokesperson Ned Price later said the statements by the unnamed official didn t reflect Washington s official position, describing Egypt as a valuable partner across many fronts.
